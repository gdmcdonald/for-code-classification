1126485xPUB47526,Porphyromonas gingivalis promotes colorectal carcinoma by activating the hematopoietic NLRP3 inflammasome,Cancer Research,2021,C1 - Refereed Journal articles,320300,,,2-s2.0-85106169444,85106169444,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a keystone periodontal pathogen associated with various digestive cancers. However, whether P. gingivalis can promote colorectal cancer and the underlying mechanism associated with such promotion remains unclear. In this study, we found that P. gingivalis was enriched in human feces and tissue samples from patients with colorectal cancer compared with those from patients with colorectal adenoma or healthy subjects. Cohort studies demonstrated that P. gingivalis infection was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. P. gingivalis increased tumor counts and tumor volume in the ApcMin/˛ mouse model and increased tumor growth in orthotopic rectal and subcutaneous carcinoma models. Furthermore, orthotopic tumors from mice exposed to P. gingivalis exhibited tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell recruitment and a proinflammatory signature. P. gingivalis promoted colorectal cancer via NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro and in vivo. NLRP3 chimeric mice harboring orthotopic tumors showed that the effect of NLRP3 on P. gingivalis pathogenesis was mediated by hematopoietic sources. Collectively, these data suggest that P. gingivalis contributes to colorectal cancer neoplasia progression by activating the hematopoietic NLRP3 inflammasome. Significance: This study demonstrates that the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis can promote colorectal tumorigenesis by recruiting myeloid cells and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment.",10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-3827,1113481,Jinlong Gao,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Dental School,Sydney Dental School

Past research studied termite building activities rather than the actual material structure. Yet, prior to understanding how multi-functionality shaped termite building, a thorough grasp of submillimetre mechanistic architecture of mounds is required. Here, we identify for Nasutitermes exitiosus via granulometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, preferential particle sizes related to coarse silts and unknown mixtures of organic/inorganic components. High-resolution micro-computed X-ray tomography and microindentation tests reveal wall patterns of filigree laminated layers and sub-millimetre porosity wrapped around a coarse-grained inner scaffold. The scaffold geometry, which is designed of a lignin-based composite and densely biocementitious stercoral mortar, resembles that of trabecula cancellous bones. Fractal dimension estimates indicate multi-scaled porosity, important for enhanced evaporative cooling and structural stability. The indentation moduli increase from the outer to the inner wall parts to values higher than those found in loose clays and which exceed locally the properties of anthropogenic cementitious materials. Termites engineer intricately layered biocementitious composites of high elasticity. The multiple-scales and porosity of the structure indicate a potential to pioneer bio-architected lightweight and high-strength materials.",10.1098/rsif.2020.0957,1178333,Mohammad Saadatfar,Faculty of Engineering,School of Civil Engineering,Civil Engineering
1000467xPUB2799,Characterising infant and young child feeding practices and the consumption of poultry products in rural Tanzania: A mixed methods approach,Maternal and Child Nutrition,2018,C1 - Refereed Journal articles,420600,300603,,2-s2.0-85044324104,85044324104,"Suboptimal breastfeeding practices, early initiation of complementary feeding, and monotonous cereal-based diets have been implicated as contributors to continuing high rates of child undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Nutrition-sensitive interventions, including agricultural programs that increase access to nutrient-rich vegetables, legumes, and animal-source foods, have the potential to achieve sustainable improvements in children's diets. In the quest to evaluate the efficacy of such programs in improving growth and development in the first 2 years of life, there is a role for mixed methods research to better understand existing infant and young child feeding practices. This analysis forms part of a longitudinal study assessing the impact of improvements to poultry health and crop production on diets and growth of 503 randomly selected children from eight rural communities in Manyoni District in central Tanzania. Using an explanatory sequential design, the quantitative phase of data collection was conducted between May 2014 and May 2016, comprising six monthly structured questionnaires, four monthly household-level documentation of chicken and egg consumption, and fortnightly records of children's breastfeeding status. The subsequent qualitative phase involved in-depth interviews with a subset of 39 mothers in October 2016. Breastfeeding was almost universal (96.8%) and of long duration (mean = 21.7 months, SD = 3.6), but early initiation of complementary feeding was also common (74.4%; mean = 4.0 months, SD = 1.8), overwhelmingly driven by maternal perceptions of insufficient milk supply (95.0%). Chicken and eggs were infrequently eaten, but close associations between maternal and child consumption patterns (p <.001) suggest the potential for strategies that increase household-level consumption to bring nutritional benefits to young children.",10.1111/mcn.12550,1137177,Julia De Bruyn,Faculty of Science,School of Veterinary Science,Veterinary Science

The construction of the distance labeling, however, can be exhaustive especially on big graphs. For a major category of large graphs, small-world networks, the state-of-the-art approach is Pruned Landmark Labeling (PLL). PLL prunes distance labels based on a node order and directly constructs the pruned labels by performing breadth-first searches in the node order. The pruning technique, as well as the index construction, has a strong sequential nature which hinders PLL from being parallelized. It becomes an urgent issue on massive small-world networks whose index can hardly be constructed by a single thread within a reasonable time. This paper scales distance labeling on small-world networks by proposing a Parallel Shortest-distance Labeling (PSL) scheme and further reducing the index size by exploiting graph and label properties. PSL insightfully converts the PLL's node-order dependency to a shortest-distance dependence, which leads to a propagation-based parallel labeling in D rounds where D denotes the diameter of the graph. Extensive experimental results verify our efficiency on billion-scale graphs and near-linear speedup in a multi-core environment.",10.1145/3299869.3319877,1158843,Lijun Chang,Faculty of Engineering,School of Computer Science,Computer Science
1126485xPUB37023,Relating cognitive models of design creativity to the similarity of sketches generated by an AI partner,12th ACM Creativity and Cognition Conference (C and C 2019),2019,E5 - Conference Proceedings Display Only,,,,2-s2.0-85068642055,85068642055,"This paper presents and evaluates a new method for inspiring creativity in a co-creative design system. The method uses a computational model of aconceptual shift based on clustering of deep features from a database of sketches. The co-creative sketching tool maps a user's sketch to a sketch of a distinct category that has high, medium, or low visual and semantic similarity. We hypothesize that the degree of similarity between the user's and the system's sketches is associated with a range of cognitive models of creativity in a design context. We report on the findings of an empirical study that analyzes different design scenarios in which the user sketches in response to a proposed conceptual shift. The findings show that how similar the computational agent's sketch is to the user's original sketch is related to the presence of three types of design creativity in the user's response: combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational.",10.1145/3325480.3325488,1044513,Kazjon Grace,"School of Architecture, Design and Planning","Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning",Discipline of Design Lab

Once the decision to proceed with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been made, the goal of the procedure in patients with melanoma is complete resection of all lymph nodes (levels I, II, and III) in the axillary basin, respecting the anatomic relations of the axillary vein, thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle, and long thoracic nerve. Performed properly, ALND offers excellent locoregional disease control with acceptably low morbidity rates. While metastasis to epitrochlear nodes is a rare event, epitrochlear lymph node dissection may similarly be an important component of treatment for melanoma patients.",10.1007/978-3-030-05070-2_21,1002315,John Thompson,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Medical School,Central Clinical School: Surgery

Nutrition-sensitive interventions, including agricultural programs that increase access to nutrient-rich vegetables, legumes, and animal-source foods, have the potential to achieve sustainable improvements in children's diets. In the quest to evaluate the efficacy of such programs in improving growth and development in the first 2 years of life, there is a role for mixed methods research to better understand existing infant and young child feeding practices. This analysis forms part of a longitudinal study assessing the impact of improvements to poultry health and crop production on diets and growth of 503 randomly selected children from eight rural communities in Manyoni District in central Tanzania. Using an explanatory sequential design, the quantitative phase of data collection was conducted between May 2014 and May 2016, comprising six monthly structured questionnaires, four monthly household-level documentation of chicken and egg consumption, and fortnightly records of children's breastfeeding status. The subsequent qualitative phase involved in-depth interviews with a subset of 39 mothers in October 2016. Breastfeeding was almost universal (96.8%) and of long duration (mean = 21.7 months, SD = 3.6), but early initiation of complementary feeding was also common (74.4%; mean = 4.0 months, SD = 1.8), overwhelmingly driven by maternal perceptions of insufficient milk supply (95.0%). Chicken and eggs were infrequently eaten, but close associations between maternal and child consumption patterns (p <.001) suggest the potential for strategies that increase household-level consumption to bring nutritional benefits to young children.",10.1111/mcn.12550,1137177,Julia De Bruyn,Faculty of Science,School of Veterinary Science,Veterinary Science,"Agricultural, Veterinary And Food Sciences","Other agricultural, veterinary and food sciences",300000,309900,0.634,"Agricultural, Veterinary And Food Sciences",Food sciences,300000.0,300600.0,0.618,Biological Sciences,Zoology,310000.0,310900.0,0.534,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True

Subsequently, the composition of the most active phlorotannin extracts was determined. Microwave assisted extraction (MAE) using water was the most efficient extraction process with shorter processing times and a higher purity product than obtained with any of the other methods tested. MAE resulted in the fast, effective decomposition of the cellular structure, as identified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and this related directly to the efficiency of extraction. Phlorotannins extracted from C. flexuosum by MAE had the strongest antioxidant activity (62.1 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dw of seaweed) and more than 5.5-fold greater 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability than ascorbic acid after 7-day incubation periods at 30 °C and at 60 °C. Six major chemical species of phlorotannin, belonging to the fuhalol group, were identified within the MAE extract using NMR and HPLC-MS.

A need exists to efficiently elucidate the structures and post-translational-modifications of these difficult-to-isolate peptide hormones in planta so that their biological functions can be determined. A mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approach was developed to comprehensively analyze the secreted peptidome of Medicago hairy root cultures and xylem sap. We identified 759 spectra corresponding to the secreted products of twelve peptide hormones including four CEP (C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE), two CLE (CLV3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION RELATED) and six XAP (XYLEM SAP ASSOCIATED PEPTIDE) peptides. The MtCEP1, MtCEP2, MtCEP5 and MtCEP8 peptides identified differed in post-translational- modifications. Most were hydroxylated at conserved proline residues but some MtCEP1 derivatives were tri-arabinosylated. In addition, many CEP peptides possessed unexpected N- and C-terminal extensions. The pattern of these extensions suggested roles for endo- and exoproteases in CEP peptide maturation. Longer than expected, hydroxylated and homogeneously modified mono- and tri-arabinosylated CEP peptides corresponding to their in vivo structures were chemically synthesized to probe the effect of these post-translational-modifications on function. The ability of CEP peptides to elevate root nodule number was increased by hydroxylation at key positions. MtCEP1 peptides with N-terminal extensions or with tri-arabinosylation modification, however, were unable to impart increased nodulation. The MtCLE5 and MtCLE17 peptides identified were of precise size, and inhibited main root growth and increased lateral root number. Six XAP peptides, each beginning with a conserved DY sulfation motif, were identified including MtXAP1a, MtXAP1b, MtXAP1c, MtXAP3, MtXAP5 and MtXAP7. MtXAP1a and MtXAP5 inhibited lateral root emergence. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated peptide hormone gene expression in the root vasculature and tip. Since hairy roots can be induced on many plants, their corresponding root cultures may represent ideal source materials to efficiently identify diverse peptide hormones in vivo in a broad range of species.",10.1074/mcp.RA117.000168,1122757,Leo Corcilius,Faculty of Science,School of Chemistry,Chemistry,Biological Sciences,Plant biology,310000,310800,0.941,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

In order to follow disease progression and evaluate effectiveness of potential treatments involved in neuroinflammation, it is important to track neuroinflammatory markers in vivo longitudinally. The translocator protein (TSPO) is used as a target to image neuroinflammation as its expression is upregulated in reactive glial cells during CNS pathologies. However, it remains unclear in which microglial phenotypes TSPO levels are upregulated, as microglia can display a plethora of activation states that can be protective or detrimental to the CNS. Procedures: We assessed the levels of TSPO transcripts in cultured microglia that were polarized into pro- and anti-inflammatory states in vitro and in the brain of mice in which an anti-inflammatory environment was induced in vivo. In addition, we used a mouse model of peroxisomal multifunctional protein-2 (MFP2) deficiency that exhibits widespread neuroinflammation despite no neuronal loss and monitored TSPO expression by immunohistochemistry and by imaging using the TSPO radiotracer [18F]DPA-714. Results: TSPO expression was selectively increased in so-called classically activated or M1 microglia but not in alternatively activated or M2 microglia in vitro. In agreement, TSPO transcript levels were not induced in an anti-inflammatory brain environment. We found that both transcript and protein levels of TSPO are significantly increased in the brain of Mfp2?/? compared to those of the control mice and TSPO immunoreactivity colocalized predominantly with microglia in Mfp2?/? brain. In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography in Mfp2?/? mice using the TSPO radiotracer [18F]DPA-714 confirmed increased expression of TSPO. These data demonstrate that TSPO imaging reveals microgliosis in non-neurodegenerative brain pathologies. Conclusions: We show that induced TSPO expression marks a pro-inflammatory brain environment that is not necessarily accompanied by neuronal loss.",10.1007/s11307-017-1099-1,1047231,Michael Kassiou,Faculty of Science,School of Chemistry,Chemistry,Biological Sciences,Biochemistry and cell biology,310000,310100,0.885,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Genetics suggests RDN1 (ROOT-DETERMINED NODULATION 1) arabinosylates MtCLE12 to enable SUNN perception. The functional structures of MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 peptides, however, remain elusive. We combined genetic and chemical synthesis approaches to determine if glyco-modifications of three nodule-expressed CLE peptides are essential for AON. We also examined how root and shoot applied AON-CLEs inhibit nodulation. MtCLE12, MtCLE13 and MtCLE42 peptides were synthesized with hydroxylation, mono-arabinosylation or tri-arabinosylation (TaP) at proline 7. Only MtCLE12-TaP and MtCLE13-TaP peptides induced AON in wild-type (WT) and rdn1-1, but not in sunn-4. The application of MtCLE13-TaP to cotyledons 1 d before rhizobial inoculation completely inhibited both rhizobial infection and nodulation. By contrast, MtCLE12-TaP induced significant AON without abolishing rhizobial infection. The results indicate that key CLE domain amino acids and TaP modifications to MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 are essential for SUNN-dependent AON. We also show evidence that RDN1 does not tri-arabinosylate MtCLE13. Finally, MtCLE13-TaP can induce a strong AON response in shoots that inhibits the entire symbiotic processes in roots.

However, approaches that co-opt endogenous organelles may be limited by the potential for unwanted crosstalk and disruption of native metabolic functions. Here, we present the construction of synthetic non-endogenous organelles in the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on the prokaryotic family of self-assembling proteins known as encapsulins. We establish that encapsulins self-assemble to form nanoscale compartments in yeast, and that heterologous proteins can be selectively targeted for compartmentalization. Housing destabilized proteins within encapsulin compartments afford protection against proteolytic degradation in vivo, while the interaction between split protein components is enhanced upon co-localization within the compartment interior. Furthermore, encapsulin compartments can support enzymatic catalysis, with substrate turnover observed for an encapsulated yeast enzyme.

In parallel, the field of dynamic DNA nanotechnology has built DNA circuits, motors and switches. More recently, these two areas have begun to merge—to produce switchable DNA nanostructures, which change state in response to their environment. In this review, we summarise switchable DNA nanostructures into two major classes based on response type: molecular actuation triggered by local chemical changes such as pH or concentration and external actuation driven by light, electric or magnetic fields. While molecular actuation has been well explored, external actuation of DNA nanostructures is a relatively new area that allows for the remote control of nanoscale devices.

This work demonstrates a soft, pneumatic ring oscillator that induces temporally coordinated periodic motion in soft actuators using a single, constant-pressure source, without hard valves or electronic controls. The fundamental unit of this ring oscillator is a soft, pneumatic inverter (an inverting Schmitt trigger) that switches between its two states (“on” and “off”) using two instabilities in elastomeric structures: buckling of internal tubing and snap-through of a hemispherical membrane. An odd number of these inverters connected in a loop produces the same number of periodically oscillating outputs, resulting from a third, system-level instability; the frequency of oscillation depends on three system parameters that can be adjusted. These oscillatory output pressures enable several applications, including undulating and rolling motions in soft robots, size-based particle separation, pneumatic mechanotherapy, and metering of fluids. The soft ring oscillator eliminates the need for hard valves and electronic controls in these applications.",10.1126/scirobotics.aaw5496,1142349,Haihui Joy Jiang,Faculty of Science,School of Chemistry,Chemistry,Engineering,"Electronics, sensors and digital hardware",400000,400900,0.587,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

It is a common feature of many central nervous system disorders, including a range of neurodegenerative disorders. An overlap between activated microglia, pro-inflammatory cytokines and translocator protein (TSPO) ligand binding was shown in early animal studies of neurodegeneration. These findings have been translated in clinical studies, where increases in TSPO positron emission tomography (PET) signal occur in disease-relevant areas across a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. While this supports the use of TSPO PET as a biomarker to monitor response in clinical trials of novel neurodegenerative therapeutics, the clinical utility of current TSPO PET radioligands has been hampered by the lack of high affinity binding to a prevalent form of polymorphic TSPO (A147T) compared to wild type TSPO. This review details recent developments in exploration of ligand-sensitivity to A147T TSPO that have yielded ligands with improved clinical utility. In addition to developing a non-discriminating TSPO ligand, the final frontier of TSPO biomarker research requires developing an understanding of the cellular and functional interpretation of the TSPO PET signal.

Tau aggregates can form in different cell types of the central nervous system (CNS) but are most prevalent in neurons. Wehave previously recapitulated aspects of humanFTDin mouse models by overexpressing mutant human tau in CNS neurons, including a P301S tau variant in TAU58/2 mice, characterized by early-onset and progressive behavioral deficits and FTD-like neuropathology. The molecular mechanisms underlying the functional deficits of TAU58/2 mice remain mostly elusive. Here, we employed functional genomics (i.e. RNAseq) to determine differentially expressed genes in young and aged TAU58/2 mice to identify alterations in cellular processes that may contribute to neuropathy. We identified genes in cortical brain samples differentially regulated between young and old TAU58/2 mice relative to nontransgenic littermates and by comparative analysis with a dataset of CNS cell type-specific genes expressed in nontransgenic mice. Most differentiallyregulated genes had known or putative roles in neurons and included presynaptic and excitatory genes. Specifically, we observed changes in presynaptic factors, glutamatergic signaling, and protein scaffolding. Moreover, in the aged mice, expression levels of several genes whose expression was annotated to occur in other brain cell types were altered. Immunoblotting and immunostaining of brain samples from the TAU58/2 mice confirmed altered expression and localization of identified and network-linked proteins.

At present, eHealth education is largely focused on components of eHealth rather than considering a curriculum-wide approach. Objective: This study aimed to develop a framework that could be used to guide health curriculum design based on current evidence, and stakeholder perceptions of eHealth capabilities expected of tertiary health graduates. Methods: A 3-phase, mixed-methods approach incorporated the results of a literature review, focus groups, and a Delphi process to develop a framework of eHealth capability statements. Results: Participants (N=39) with expertise or experience in eHealth education, practice, or policy provided feedback on the proposed framework, and following the fourth iteration of this process, consensus was achieved. The final framework consisted of 4 higher-level capability statements that describe the learning outcomes expected of university graduates across the domains of (1) digital health technologies, systems, and policies; (2) clinical practice; (3) data analysis and knowledge creation; and (4) technology implementation and codesign. Across the capability statements are 40 performance cues that provide examples of how these capabilities might be demonstrated. Conclusions: The results of this study inform a cross-faculty eHealth curriculum that aligns with workforce expectations. There is a need for educational curriculum to reinforce existing eHealth capabilities, adapt existing capabilities to make them transferable to novel eHealth contexts, and introduce new learning opportunities for interactions with technologies within education and practice encounters. As such, the capability framework developed may assist in the application of eHealth by emerging and existing health care professionals. Future research needs to explore the potential for integration of findings into workforce development programs.",10.2196/10229,1127374,Melissa Brunner,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Health Sciences,Health Sciences,Health services and systems,420000,420300,0.818,Health Sciences,Allied health and rehabilitation science,420000.0,420100.0,0.661,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Data Sources: Systematic review. We searched 6 online databases for original research published before December 31, 2016, that investigated adults undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Study Selection: We included studies that used any measure of preoperative psychological health and reported length of stay, irrespective of study design. We excluded studies that considered participants with cognitive impairment or substance abuse; studies that considered participants who experienced revision, bilateral or hip surgery; and studies that did not have full text available in English. Data Extraction: One review author screened 438 titles and abstracts for inclusion. Another author reviewed a 10% sample of excluded studies for adherence to the review protocol, with no violations observed. For all included studies, 2 authors independently extracted data from each study using a form designed a priori and independently assessed study quality according to the Joanna Briggs Checklist for Cohort Studies. Data Synthesis: In view of the heterogeneity of the included studies, we present a narrative synthesis. Of the 7 included studies, 5 reported statistically significant increases in hospital length of stay among those with worse preoperative psychological health. These differences were often <1 calendar day, and, therefore, the clinical significance of these results remains unknown, but the potential to reduce health care costs may still be significant. Conclusions: Adults experiencing worse preoperative psychological health before total knee arthroplasty may have a longer hospital stay compared to those with unremarkable psychological health.",10.1016/j.apmr.2018.03.020,200291398,Marie March,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Clinical and Rehabilitation Sciences,Health Sciences,Health services and systems,420000,420300,0.847,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.835,Health Sciences,Allied health and rehabilitation science,420000.0,420100.0,0.651,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

Method: Forty patients within 2 weeks of stroke with a very weak upper limb (<4/6 Item 6 of Motor Assessment Scale) were observed longitudinally. Upper limb activity (Items 6, 7, and 8 of Motor Assessment Scale), shoulder subluxation (vertical distance), shoulder pain (visual analogue scale), and upper limb range of motion were measured at 2, 6, and 12 weeks poststroke. Results: By Week 12, upper limb activity was 1.0/18 (IQR 3.0). Shoulder subluxation was 42 mm (SD 8), 7 mm > the intact side at 2 weeks. Pain at rest was 0.1/10 (IQR 1.1), and pain during movement was 2.6/10 (IQR 4.5). Passive shoulder external rotation was 23° (SD 34), 30% of the intact side at 2 weeks. Shoulder pain during movement at 2 weeks predicted shoulder pain during movement at 6 and 12 weeks after stroke (p = 0.05).

Assessing intrinsic foot muscles in isolation is a challenge; however ultrasound might provide a solution. The aims of this study were to assess the reproducibility of assessing the size of abductor halluces (AbH) and the medial belly of flexor hallucis brevis (FHBM) muscles, and identify their relationship with toe strength, foot morphology and balance. Methods: Twenty one participants aged 26-64years were measured on two occasions for muscle cross-sectional area using a Siemens Acuson X300 Ultrasound System with 5-13MHz linear array transducer. Great toe flexor strength was measured by pedobarography, the paper grip test and hand-held dynamometry. Foot morphology was assessed by foot length, truncated foot length, Foot Posture Index (FPI) and dorsal arch height. Balance was measured by the maximal step test. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC3,1) were used to evaluate intra-rater reliability. Pearson's correlation coefficients were performed to assess associations between muscle size and strength, morphology and balance measures. To account for the influence of physical body size, partial correlations were also performed controlling for truncated foot length. Results: Intra-rater reliability was excellent for AbH (ICC3,1=0.97) and FHBM (ICC3,1=0.96). Significant associations were found between cross-sectional area of AbH and great toe flexion force measured standing by pedobarography (r=.623, p=.003),), arch height measured sitting (r=.597, p=.004) and standing (r=.590, p=.005), foot length (r=.582, p=006), truncated foot length (r=.580, p=.006), balance (r=.443, p=.044), weight (r=.662, p=.001), height (r=.559, p=.008), and BMI (r=.502, p=.020). Significant associations were found between cross-sectional area of FHBM and FPI (r=.544, p=.011), truncated foot length (r=.483, p=.027) and foot length (r=.451, p=.040). Significant partial associations were found between AbH and great toe flexion force in standing by pedobarography (r=.562, p=.012) and FHBM and the FPI (r=.631, p=.003). Conclusions: Measuring the cross-sectional area of AbH and FHBM with ultrasound is reproducible. Measures of strength, morphology and balance appear to relate more to the size of AbH than FHBM. After controlling for physical body size, cross-sectional area of AbH remained a significant correlate of great toe flexor strength and might be a useful biomarker to measure early therapeutic response to exercise.",10.1186/s13047-018-0259-0,1169691,Penelope Latey,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Health Sciences,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Neurosciences,320000,320900,0.388,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Other biomedical and clinical sciences,320000.0,329900.0,0.343,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Objective: To investigate the association between low back pain and different types (occupational and leisure) and intensities (moderate and vigorous) of physical activity. Methods: This is cross-sectional observational study. We included in this study a total of 1059 individuals recruited from a Spanish twin registry with data available on low back pain. Outcome: Self-reported leisure and occupational physical activity were the explanatory variables. The low back pain outcome used in this study was recurrent low back pain. Results: Our results indicate that leisure physical activity is associated with a lower prevalence of recurrent low back pain. In contrast, occupational physical activity, such as carrying, lifting heavy weight while inclined, awkward postures (e.g. bending, twisting, squatting, and kneeling) are associated with a higher prevalence of recurrent low back pain. There was no statistically significant association between other occupational physical activities, such as sitting or standing, and low back pain. Conclusion: Leisure and occupational physical activity are likely to have an opposed impact on low back pain. While leisure physical activity appears to be protective, occupational physical activity appears to be harmful to low back pain. Future longitudinal studies should assist in formulating guidelines addressing specific types and intensity of physical activity aimed at effectively preventing low back pain.",10.1016/j.bjpt.2018.06.004,1157835,Anita Amorim,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Physiotherapy,Health Sciences,Epidemiology,420000,420200,0.892,Physical Sciences,Classical physics,510000.0,510300.0,0.725,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Medical physiology,320000.0,320800.0,0.68,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

Design: This was a cross-sectional observational study of 572 participants from the 1000 Norms Project, aged 3–101 years and who self-reported as being healthy. Video recordings (2D) of frontal plane gait were reviewed by physiotherapists for presence of knee thrust and quantification of HKA angle deviation (the difference between HKA angle at initial contact and mid-stance). Age and sex-stratified normative HKA angle deviation values were presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Design: This is a prospective cohort study with two-month follow-up. Subjects: A total of 106 patients presenting with non-specific CLBP of more than three months duration were recruited. Main measures: Disability measures investigated were Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. Physical activity measures analyzed include the Baecke Habitual Physical Activity Questionnaire and objective measures derived from an accelerometer (i.e. total time spent in moderate-to-vigorous and light physical activity, number of steps and counts per minute). Disability and physical activity measures were collected at the baseline and after eight weeks of treatment. For the responsiveness analyses, effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM) were calculated. Correlations between the change in disability and physical activity measures were calculated. Results: Responsiveness for disability measures was considered to be large with ESs ranging from ?1.03 to ?1.45 and SRMs ranging from ?0.99 to ?1.34, whereas all physical activity measures showed values lower than 0.20. Changes in disability measures did not correlate with changes in physical activity measures (correlation coefficients ranged from ?0.10 to 0.09). Conclusion: Disability measures were responsive after a course of physical therapy treatment in patients with CLBP. The lack of responsiveness in the physical activity measures might be due to the inability of these measures to detect change over time or the use of an intervention not designed to increase physical activity levels.",10.1177/0269215518787015,1018966,Paulo Ferreira,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Clinical and Rehabilitation Sciences,Health Sciences,Allied health and rehabilitation science,420000,420100,0.875,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.68,Physical Sciences,Classical physics,510000.0,510300.0,0.65,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True

With the increasing use of gait indices to summarise the findings of three dimensional gait analysis (3DGA), the purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between multilevel joint contractures and the Gait Profile Score in children with cerebral palsy. Methods: The Gait Profile Score, calculated from 3D gait analysis, and passive range of motion, strength and spasticity of the hips, knees and ankles in the sagittal plane were measured in 145 children with cerebral palsy (mean age:11 years,4 months; SD:2 years,10 months) (83 males) enrolled in the NSW Paediatric Gait Analysis Service Research Registry from 2011 to 2016. The relationships between these physical measures and the Gait Profile Score were explored using bivariate and multivariate correlations. Findings: Reduced hip extension, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion (knee extended) range of motion were correlated with a higher (worse) Gait Profile Score (r = ?0.348 to ?0.466, p <.001). Children with all joints contracted had a significantly higher Gait Profile Score (mean 17.5° SD 6.2°) than those with no contractures (mean 11.0° SD 2.3°) or ankle contractures only (mean 12.8° SD 5.1°) (p <.05). Knee flexion weakness, reduced hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion (knee extended) range of motion predicted 47% of the Gait Profile Score. Interpretation: The Gait Profile Score is a sensitive measure for demonstrating the relationship between multilevel sagittal plane joint contractures and kinematic gait. Clinically, this supports the use of the Gait Profile Score as a simplified measure to understand the contribution of contractures to functional gait limitations. Monitoring knee flexion strength, and hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion (knee extended) range of motion may assist clinicians in prioritising interventions to improve gait in this population.",10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2018.08.002,T20669,Sarah Holmes,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Health Sciences,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Paediatrics,320000,321300,0.716,Health Sciences,Allied health and rehabilitation science,420000.0,420100.0,0.625,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.508,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

Despite this, it is uncertain the extent to which the guidelines are followed. This study aimed to determine insurer and health professional compliance with recommendations of the 2014 NSW clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute WAD; and explore factors related to adherence. Methods: This was an observational study involving an audit of 288 randomly-selected claimant files from 4 insurance providers in NSW, Australia between March and October 2016. Data extracted included demographic, claim and injury details, use of health services, and insurer and health professional practices related to the guidelines. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. Results: Median time for general practitioner medical consultation was 4 days post-injury and 25 days for physical treatment (e.g. physiotherapy). Rates of x-ray investigations were low (21.5%) and most patients (90%) were given active treatments in line with the guideline recommendations. The frequency of other practices recommended by the guidelines suggested lower guideline adherence in some areas such as; using the Quebec Task Force classification (19.9%); not using specialised imaging for WAD grades I and II (e.g. MRI, 45.8%); not using routine passive treatments (e.g. manual therapy, 94.0%); and assessing risk of non-recovery using relevant prognostic tools (e.g. Neck Disability Index, 12.8%). Over half of the claimants (59.0%) were referred to other professionals at 9-12 weeks post-injury, among which 31.2% were to psychologists and 68.8% to specialists (surgical specialists, 43.6%; WAD specialists, 20.5%). Legal representation and lodgment of full claim were associated with increased number of medical visits and imaging (? 0.23 to 0.3; p < 0.01). Conclusion: There is evidence of positive uptake of some guideline recommendations by insurers and health professionals; however, there are practices that are not compliant and might lead to poor health outcomes and greater treatment cost.

The situational factors that young people report as impacting their well-being are not addressed as often: specifically, family discord. Kids Helpline, a national service in Australia that provides free counseling online and by telephone to young people in distress, report that family discord and well-being issues are one of the major concerns reported by clients. In order to meet the preferences that young people seek when accessing counseling support, Kids Helpline has designed and trialed a custom-built social network platform for group counseling of young people experiencing family discord that impacts their well-being. Objective: In this exploratory study, we communicate the findings of Phase 1 of an innovative study in user and online counselor experience. This will lead to an iterative design for a world-first, purpose-built social network that will do the following: (1) increase reach and quality of service by utilizing a digital tool of preference for youth to receive peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer support in a safe online environment and (2) provide the evidence base to document the best practice for online group counseling in a social network environment. Methods: The study utilized a participatory action research design. Young people aged 13-25 years (N=105) with mild-to-moderate depression or anxiety (not high risk) who contacted Kids Helpline were asked if they would like to trial the social networking site (SNS) for peer-to-peer and counselor-to-peer group support. Subjects were grouped into age cohorts of no more than one year above or below their reported age and assigned to groups of no more than 36 participants, in order to create a community of familiarity around age and problems experienced. Each group entered into an 8-week group counseling support program guided by counselors making regular posts and providing topic-specific content for psychoeducation and discussion. Counselors provided a weekly log of events to researchers; at 2-week intervals, subjects provided qualitative and quantitative feedback through open-ended questions and specific psychometric measures. Results: Qualitative results provided evidence of user support and benefits of the online group counseling environment. Counselors also reported benefits of the modality of therapy delivery. Psychometric scales did not report significance in changes of mood or affect. Counselors and users suggested improvements to the platform to increase user engagement. Conclusions: Phase 1 provided proof of concept for this mode of online counseling delivery. Users and counselors saw value in the model and innovation of the service. Phase 2 will address platform issues with changes to a new social network platform. Phase 2 will focus more broadly on mental health concerns raised by users and permit inclusion of a clinical population of young people experiencing depression and anxiety.",10.2196/16176,1011979,Andrew Campbell,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Medical Sciences,School of Medical Sciences: Biomedical Sciences,Psychology,Social and personality psychology,520000,520500,0.525,Psychology,Applied and developmental psychology,520000.0,520100.0,0.495,Psychology,Clinical and health psychology,520000.0,520300.0,0.477,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

Our aim was to design an educational resource for health science students to 1) engage students in the topic of ethics and 2) facilitate their skills to identify, manage and communicate ethical issues during professional placements. The Ethics in Professional Practice (EPP) resource was developed using collaborative design-based research by an interprofessional, Work Integrated Learning team. We drew upon Barab and Squire's (2004) approach, with cycles of design, analysis, redesign and feedback informing resource development. The EPP resource comprises five video case studies that reflect ethical issues from diverse professional practice environments and include perspectives from students, clinical educators, clients and caregivers. The student is cast as a central character who must decide what actions may be taken to resolve ethical conflict. Complementary ethics education resources include reflective questions, guides to ethical reasoning and goal-setting resources. The resource was implemented with a cohort of 15 graduate-entry exercise physiology students and 59 undergraduate speech pathology students from the University of Sydney. Student feedback was utilised to inform resource redesign. Findings indicated that students valued the authentic ethics scenarios but experienced challenges when navigating online learning activities. Redesign focussed on enhancing interactive design features and improving accessibility of learning activities.

Prevention of age-related cognitive impairment in older persons with lifestyle interventions continues to garner evidence but whether this can combat underlying neurodegeneration is unknown. The Study of Mental Activity and Resistance Training (SMART) trial has previously reported within-training findings; the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term neurostructural and cognitive impact of resistance exercise in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For the first time we show that hippocampal subareas particularly susceptible to volume loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are protected by resistance exercise for up to one year after training. One hundred MCI participants were randomised to one of four training groups: (1) Combined high intensity progressive resistance and computerised cognitive training (PRT+CCT), (2) PRT+Sham CCT, (3) CCT+Sham PRT, (4) Sham physical+sham cognitive training (SHAM+SHAM). Physical, neuropsychological and MRI assessments were carried out at baseline, 6 months (directly after training) and 18 months from baseline (12 months after intervention cessation). Here we report neuro-structural and functional changes over the 18-month trial period and the association with global cognitive and executive function measures. PRT but not CCT or PRT+CCT led to global long-term cognitive improvements above SHAM intervention at 18-month follow-up. Furthermore, hippocampal subfields susceptible to atrophy in AD were protected by PRT revealing an elimination of long-term atrophy in the left subiculum, and attenuation of atrophy in left CA1 and dentate gyrus when compared to SHAM+SHAM (p = 0.023, p = 0.020 and p = 0.027). These neuroprotective effects mediated a significant portion of long-term cognitive benefits. By contrast, within-training posterior cingulate plasticity decayed after training cessation and was unrelated to long term cognitive benefits. Neither general physical activity levels nor fitness change over the 18-month period mediated hippocampal trajectory, demonstrating that enduring hippocampal subfield plasticity is not a simple reflection of post-training changes in fitness or physical activity participation. Notably, resting-state fMRI analysis revealed that both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate participate in a functional network that continued to be upregulated following intervention cessation. Multiple structural mechanisms may contribute to the long-term global cognitive benefit of resistance exercise, developing along different time courses but functionally linked. For the first time we show that 6 months of high intensity resistance exercise is capable of not only promoting better cognition in those with MCI, but also protecting AD-vulnerable hippocampal subfields from degeneration for at least 12 months post-intervention. These findings emphasise the therapeutic potential of resistance exercise; however, future work will need to establish just how long-lived these outcomes are and whether they are sufficient to delay dementia.",10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102182,1144609,Kathryn Broadhouse,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Medical School,Central Clinical School: Medicine,Psychology,Cognitive and computational psychology,520000,520400,0.767,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Neurosciences,320000.0,320900.0,0.705,Psychology,Biological psychology,520000.0,520200.0,0.687,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

This systematic review and meta-Analysis examined the strength of the association between obesity and falls, multiple falls, fall-related injuries, and fall-related fractures among older adults. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, LILACS, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify observational studies that assessed the association between obesity and fall-related outcomes in participants aged 60 years and older. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and quality assessment. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random effect meta-Analyses. Results: Thirty-one studies including a total of 1,758,694 participants were selected from 7,815 references. Pooled estimates showed that obese older adults have an increased risk of falls compared with nonobese counterparts (24 studies; relative risk: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.07-1.26; I2: 90%). Obesity was also associated with an increased risk of multiple falls (four studies; relative risk: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08-1.29; I2: 0%). There was no evidence, however, of an association between obesity and fall-related injuries (seven studies; relative risk: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.92-1.18; I2: 65%). Fall-related fractures were reported in only one study, which demonstrated a lower risk of hip fracture with obesity (odds ratio: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.63-0.68). Conclusions: Obesity increases the risk of falls and multiple falls in people aged 60 years and older; however, there is insufficient evidence of an association with fall-related injuries or fractures.

Are the effects of home-based exercise similar to those of equivalent centre-based exercise? Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials. Participants: Adults diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Intervention: Predominantly home-based prescribed exercise (defined as a minimum of two-thirds of the exercise being completed at home). The intervention had to primarily involve physical practice of exercises targeting gait and/or standing balance compared with either control (ie, usual care only, a sham intervention or no physiotherapy) or equivalent predominantly centre-based exercise. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was balance-related activities and the secondary outcomes were gait speed, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach test, and quality of life. Results: Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria and all contributed to the meta-analyses. Twelve trials compared home-based prescribed exercise with control, and four trials compared home-based prescribed exercise with equivalent centre-based exercise.

Objective: The objectives of this study were threefold: (1) to systematically review the literature on female adaptations to RT, characterising the effect in terms of muscular strength and hypertrophy; (2) to distinguish the individual effects of intervention duration, frequency, and intensity on these adaptations via sub-analysis; (3) to draw evidence-based conclusions regarding training expectations in female populations. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched using terms related to RT combined with females or women. Random-effects meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the effect of RT on muscular strength and hypertrophy in females. Possible predictors that may have influenced training-related effects (e.g., training intensity and volume) were explored using univariate analyses. Results: The systematic search identified 14,067 articles of which a total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were eligible. Upper body strength was assessed in 15 studies, lower body strength in 19 studies, and muscular hypertrophy in 15 studies. Study duration lasted between 4 weeks and 12 months. Large-effect sizes were found for upper body strength (Hedges’ g = 1.70; p < 0.001) and lower body strength (Hedges’ g = 1.40; p < 0.001). Following use of the Trim and Fill method (due to presence of publication bias), a large effect still remained for upper body strength (Hedges’ g = 1.07), although a medium effect was found for lower body strength (Hedges’ g = 0.52). A medium effect was found for muscular hypertrophy (g = 0.52, p = 0.002). Sub-analyses revealed that the moderating variables “training frequency” and “training volume” significantly influenced lower body muscular strength (p < 0.001). “Training frequency” and “sets per exercise” moderated the RT effects on upper body strength (p < 0.01). No moderating variables were found to significantly influence muscular hypertrophy. A trend for a moderating effect on upper body strength was found for “age of participants” (p = 0.08), whereby younger participants experienced a greater effect. A moderating effect was also observed where supervised training had a larger influence on the adaptation of lower body strength (p = 0.05) compared with unsupervised training. Methodological quality for the studies included in the review was found to be moderate. Conclusions: RT elicits large improvements in muscular strength and hypertrophy in healthy adult females.

Exergaming, a form of active video gaming, can provide an alternative upper body exercise that is dose-potent (moderate-vigorous intensity). Objective: This cross-sectional study sought to assess Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) for three types of exercise, Move Boxing (MB), Move Kayaking (MK) and ACE, when conducted within similar heart rate (HR) training zones. Methods: Biomechanical descriptions, RPE and PACES scores were taken for each session. Analyses of variance with Hedge's g were used for significant differences and effect sizes in HR, RPE and PACES scores between the three types of exercises and injury category. Results: The average HR was not different (p=0.489) between exercises (ACE: 110±15, MB: 114±19; MK: 115±17).

This paper presents the findings that relate to barriers to delivering services for Aboriginal people with disability. Methods: In-depth interviews and focus groups were held with Aboriginal people with disability and their carers aged at least 18 years from the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (NPY) Lands and community organisations providing services there. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: There were 109 participants, of whom 47 were workers in service provider organisations and 62 were Aboriginal people. From the data, barriers to delivering services to support Aboriginal people to live a good life and solutions to overcome the barriers, were identified and described under the headings of environmental barriers and systemic issues. Conclusions: We discuss the policy implications of these findings with regard to addressing Indigenous disadvantage and how governments, service providers, communities, and Aboriginal people with disability and their families can work in partnership to address these barriers.Implications for Rehabilitation Indigenous people with disability living in remote and very remote communities experience significant access and equity barriers to culturally responsive services that enable them to live a socially and culturally engaged life. Localised government and service provider disability policy approaches in Indigenous communities need to focus on both environmental and systemic issues. Greater investment in local remote communities is required to build the capacity of Indigenous families to support Aboriginal people with a disability to live a culturally and socially included life.",10.1080/09638288.2020.1725654,1122520,John Gilroy,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Behavioural and Social Sciences in Health,Indigenous Studies,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, society and community",450000,450500,0.734,Indigenous Studies,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sciences,450000.0,450600.0,0.682,Indigenous Studies,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing,450000.0,450400.0,0.636,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

Study design Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature. Data sources MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, CINAHL, Informit, PsychInfo and Cochrane Library, Australian Indigenous Health InfoNet. Study selection Peer-reviewed article describing an original study; published in English prior to December 2017; inclusion of one or more of the following outcome measures: nutritional status, food/dietary/nutrient intake, diet-related biomedical markers, anthropometric or health measures; and conducted with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data and applied the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies from the Effective Public Health Practice Project. A purpose designed tool assessed community engagement in research, and a framework was applied to interventions to report a score based on numbers of settings and strategies. Heterogeneity of studies precluded a meta-analysis. The effect size of health outcome results were estimated and presented as forest plots. Results Thirty-five articles (26 studies) met inclusion criteria; two rated moderate in quality; 12 described cohort designs; 18 described interventions in remote/very remote communities; none focused solely on urban communities; and 11 reported moderate or strong community engagement. Six intervention types were identified. Statistically significant improvements were reported in 14 studies of which eight reported improvements in biochemical/haematological markers and either anthropometric and/or diet-related outcomes. Conclusions Store-based intervention with community health promotion in very remote communities, fiscal strategies and nutrition education and promotion programmes show promise. Future dietary intervention studies must be rigorously evaluated, provide intervention implementation details explore scale up of programmes, include urban communities and consider a multisetting and strategy approach.

The aim of this paper is to review the literature to inform a theoretical framework for fall prevention in older adults with dementia. Summary: A narrative review was conducted on fall risk factors in people with cognitive impairment, the relationship between cognition and gait, and their joint impact on the risk of falls. This was used to develop a theoretical framework for fall prevention for people with dementia. Executive function and motor function are closely related as they share neuroanatomy. This close relationship has been confirmed by observational studies including neuroimaging and intervention studies. Executive function is the cognitive domain most commonly associated with gait dysfunction. Attention, sensory integration, and motor planning are the sub-domains of executive function associated with risk of falls through gait dysfunction, whereas cognitive flexibility, judgement, and inhibitory control affect risk of falls through risk-taking behaviour. Key Messages: Gait, cognition, and falls are closely related. The comorbidity and interaction between gait abnormality and cognitive impairment may underpin the high prevalence of falls in older adults with dementia. Gait assessment and cognitive assessment, particularly executive function, should be integrated in fall risk screening. Assessment results should be interpreted and utilised using a multidisciplinary approach; specific strategies such as customised gait training and behavioural modulation should be considered as part of falls prevention for people with dementia.",10.1159/000504340,1179910,Weihong Zhang,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Health Sciences,Health Sciences,Allied health and rehabilitation science,420000,420100,0.791,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Neurosciences,320000.0,320900.0,0.675,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.616,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,True

Methods: We conducted a Delphi study to develop a consensus on the necessary and desirable psychological intervention strategies for chronic pain management. First, we identified 49 components of treatments that had been used in a treatment evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) through a systematic review. In the first round of the Delphi process, 23 (32% of 72) authors who had completed RCTs in chronic pain took part. In round 2, these experts plus clinicians working at pain management programs around Australia were invited to take part, and 44 experts completed the study. Results: The panel agreed that it was necessary to include psycho-education, particularly about pain mechanisms and the role of thoughts in maintaining pain. Cognitive approaches were deemed necessary, although the panel did not specify one particular strategy. Finally, approaches to increase activity were deemed necessary, including the strategies of pacing, goal setting and graded exposure. Relaxation training and relapse prevention were also deemed necessary. Conclusions: There was a consensus that there were many desirable strategies to include in psychological chronic pain management approaches, but that treatments should include psycho-education, approaches to increase activity and cognitive approaches as a first line of intervention. Where patients fail to benefit from these approaches, experts identified other desirable strategies that could be utilized. Significance: The expert consensus indicated that psycho-education, strategies to increase activity and cognitive therapy strategies were necessary for effective psychological treatment of patients with chronic pain. While other strategies were deemed desirable, psychological treatments should include at least those three components.",10.1002/ejp.1561,1010615,Louise Sharpe,Faculty of Science,School of Psychology,Psychology,Psychology,Clinical and health psychology,520000,520300,0.904,Health Sciences,Health services and systems,420000.0,420300.0,0.845,Psychology,Applied and developmental psychology,520000.0,520100.0,0.717,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,True

Dry eye syndrome may develop. There may be damage to the corneal epithelium, causing irritation and ulceration. Radiation-induced cataracts commonly develop in the posterior sub-capsular (PSC) region of the lens and are more common in the left eye. Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the ophthalmological findings in South African interventionalists occupationally exposed to IR. Setting: This study was conducted in South Africa. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted. Interventional radiologists (25), adult cardiologists (42) and paediatric cardiologists (31) were recruited at conferences and included in the study. Convenience sampling was used. Participants completed a survey that collected data on their demographics, their cataract risk factors and co-morbid diseases, their occupational history, their radiation safety practices and their training in occupational history. Participants' eyes were examined using a slit lamp after dilation of the eyes. Ethics clearance was obtained and each participant gave informed consent. A descriptive analysis was done. Results: The median age of the 98 interventionalists screened was 43.5 years. They worked with radiation for a median of 7.5 years. Cataracts occurred in the left eye of 17 (17.3%) participants and in the right eye of nine (9.2%). There were five (5.1%) PSC cataracts in the left eye and one (1%) in the right eye. The vitreous was abnormal in 19.4% of participants. The tear break-up time was abnormal in 48% of participants. Conclusion: Ionising radiation is an occupational hazard posing a risk to interventionalists' eyes. They are at increased risk of cataracts and dry eye syndrome, which can affect their occupational performance and quality of life. Education can positively influence the radiation safety practices of interventionalists that could reduce the detrimental effects of IR on their eyes.",10.4102/aveh.v78i1.480,1161646,William Rae,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Medical Radiation Sciences,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Ophthalmology and optometry,320000,321200,0.711,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.501,,,,,,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,True

This is leading to significant transformations in key sites for fresh fruit production. This chapter sets out the background contexts for this issue and proposes a framework to understand these transformations. It argues that the value chains that are evolving to service this trade present distinctive differences from those that have evolved to provide fresh fruit exports in markets of the global North, because of unique characteristics in the Chinese market. These differences are manifested in (1) highly selective geographical incorporation of mainland Southeast Asian fresh fruit industries into the orbit of Chinese demand because of the complex bilateral trade rules and institutional arrangements for trade, and (2) greater pluralism in chain governance with, in particular, power and control being exercised more prominently by mid-chain actors including Chinese traders and brokers.",,1001383,William (Bill) Pritchard,Faculty of Science,School of Geosciences,Geosciences,"Agricultural, Veterinary And Food Sciences","Agriculture, land and farm management",300000,300200,0.678,"Agricultural, Veterinary And Food Sciences","Other agricultural, veterinary and food sciences",300000.0,309900.0,0.659,"Agricultural, Veterinary And Food Sciences",Crop and pasture production,300000.0,300400.0,0.556,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Despite receiving instructions on how to fix the virus and warnings about the dangers of not doing so, there are many cases where owners are still not taking the required recovery action. Research on individual behavior and decision-making in a virus-infection situation is important for developing protection systems for information security. This paper describes a threat appeals model for information security based on collective protection motivation theory. The analytical results obtained using this model are also discussed. Our results show that the response efficacy for the Japanese Students is effective in persuading a person to initiate protection measures. And the results also indicate that a trustworthy source of media for providing the security information is necessary to realize a protection measure for Australia students.",10.1007/978-3-319-65521-5_45,1036709,John Stavrakakis,Faculty of Engineering,School of Computer Science,Computer Science,Information And Computing Sciences,Other information and computing sciences,460000,469900,0.838,Information And Computing Sciences,Distributed computing and systems software,460000.0,460600.0,0.806,Information And Computing Sciences,Information systems,460000.0,460900.0,0.643,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False

For some children, however, these skills are acquired with difficulty and extra support is required. A range of digital tools are available to assist with this: some of these are based on theories of speech and language acquisition, while others have been developed in response to market demands. Few empirical studies of digital tools for speech and language development have been carried out though some success has been noted when facilitated by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Given the interactional capabilities of digital tools, it would be helpful to identify whether they could achieve similar results independent of SLP support. One such tool, Phoneme Factory Sound Sorter®, was tested in a randomised controlled trial with early childhood educators delivering the intervention. Improvement in speech production varied across both groups and significant differences were not observed. However, supplementary investigations found that parents and educators were positive towards the use of digital tools, and findings relating to the implementation of the intervention have been identified, which provide useful information for settings looking to use digital tools to promote speech and language skills in children.",10.1007/978-981-10-6484-5_15,1005232,Elise Baker,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Disability and Community,Information And Computing Sciences,Human-centred computing,460000,460800,0.819,Information And Computing Sciences,Applied computing,460000.0,460100.0,0.819,Education,Education systems,390000.0,390300.0,0.805,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Second, work is reviewed that highlights the potential to design novel treatment components to target the unique needs of a specific subgroup of children based on basic research into the risk mechanisms implicated in those needs. A third line of work reviewed focuses on theory and evidence that informs the integration of novel treatment components with those of existing interventions.

The inference here is that the increased specialisation of disciplines has created isolation, division, exclusion, separation and fixity within research and learning. This chapter explores the potential for openness in university research and learning through a discussion of the relationality of transdisciplinarity and disciplinarity. An examination of this relationality is valuable, given that transdisciplinarity and disciplinarity are intimately connected and co-dependent. This relationality is explored through two concepts that we argue constitute its potential to create openness in university research and learning: pliability and transversality. This chapter argues that disciplines, be they science, planning, law, health or religion, manage to be both open to change, constantly becoming-other, and universal, abstract, and eternal. Whilst this pliability of disciplinarity is often translated as disciplinary inadequacy, we argue that this pliability is a valuable component of disciplinarity, and that it provides the site for the transversality of transdisciplinarity. We explore these concepts through reference to a recent problematization of disciplinary research and learning at the human and environment nexus, which has given rise to the notion of planetary health, and its call for a substantial and urgent opening of research and learning to understand and address emerging geo-social assemblages such as the Anthropocene.",10.1007/978-3-319-93743-4_5,1000922,Carole Cusack,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Humanities,Discipline of Studies in Religion,Education,"Education policy, sociology and philosophy",390000,390200,0.683,Philosophy And Religious Studies,Philosophy,500000.0,500300.0,0.573,Education,Education systems,390000.0,390300.0,0.572,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

Protein phosphorylation impacts neurotransmitter release and is likely to be mechanistically important for presynaptic plasticity, although only a few mechanisms have been described to date. Thus, interactomics and phosphoproteomics are important tools to determine presynaptic mechanisms. Over the last two decades, mass spectrometry-based proteomics has become the method of choice for protein-protein and protein phosphorylation analysis. This protocol is based on well-established procedures in our laboratory and will describe the application of affinity purification of presynaptic proteins via GST-fusion protein pull-downs for the study of presynaptic phospho-signalling. The pull-down is followed by on-bead proteolysis, chemical stable isotope labelling for precise quantification, enrichment of phosphorylated peptides using TiO2, and LC-MS/MS.

The research focuses on timber technologies and prefabricated timber components, which are frequently selected in preference to other industrialised building systems because of the advantages they offer in terms of weight, workability and sustainability strategies. A knowledge-based engineering methodology is explored for the design of prefabricated timber-framed external walls, encoding both “explicit” and “tacit” knowledge into a digital three-dimensional model. Results demonstrate how such an approach could significantly change common design practices by shifting the major phase of design effort to earlier stages in the project cycle, thereby minimising re-work, reducing data fragmentation and potentially removing the need for drawings. A key finding of this paper is that model interoperability, maintenance and reuse becomes unlikely if an agreed methodology, including a description logic, is not adopted. Despite the need for a rigorous approach, the ability to capture, manage and reuse design knowledge could be of significant benefit to emerging industrialised house building ventures.",10.1007/978-3-030-03676-8_40,1155508,Graham Day,"School of Architecture, Design and Planning","Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning",Discipline of Architecture,Built Environment And Design,Architecture,330000,330100,0.985,Built Environment And Design,Building,330000.0,330200.0,0.967,Built Environment And Design,Design,330000.0,330300.0,0.947,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True

The second part repositions timber architecture typologies using the framework discussed in the first part.

Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are currently the most popular gene delivery system for targeting the liver, reflecting high transduction efficiency in vivo and the availability of a toolkit of multiple different capsids with high liver tropism. While AAV vectors confer stable gene transfer in the relatively quiescent adult liver, the predominantly episomal nature of AAV vector genomes results in less stable expression in the growing liver as a consequence of episome clearance during hepatocellular replication. This is an important consideration in experimental design involving young animals, particularly mice, where liver growth is rapid. Given the immense value of murine models for dissecting disease pathophysiology, experimental therapeutics and vector development, this technical manuscript focuses on AAV-mediated transduction of the mouse liver. Xenograft models, in which chimeric mouse-human livers can be established, are also amenable to AAV-mediated gene transfer and have proven to be powerful tools for in vivo selection and characterization of novel human-specific capsids. While yet to be confirmed, such models have the potential to more accurately predict transduction efficiency of clinical candidate vectors than nonhuman primate models.",10.1007/978-1-4939-9065-8_12,1111872,Sharon Cunningham,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Medical Research Institutes,Childrens Medical Research Institute (CMRI),Biological Sciences,Genetics,310000,310500,0.828,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Despite this ubiquity, benchmarking is usually a difficult process involving laborious tasks such as writing and debugging custom testbed scripts, or extracting and transforming output into useful formats. To date, there are only a limited number of comprehensive benchmarking frameworks designed to tackle these usability and efficiency challenges directly. In this paper we propose a new versatile benchmarking framework. Our design, not yet implemented, is based on exploration of the benchmarking practices of individuals in the database community. Through user interviews, we identify major pain points these people encountered during benchmarking, and map these onto a pipeline of processes representative of a typical benchmarking workflow. We explain how our proposed framework would target each process in this pipeline, potentiating significant overall usability and efficiency improvements. We also contrast the responses of engineers working in industry with those of researchers, and examine how database benchmarking requirements differ between these two groups. The framework we propose is based around traditional synthetic workloads, would be simple to configure, highly extensible, could support any benchmark, and write output to any well-defined data format.

To cope with these issues, one solution is upgrading the distribution system to which DERs are connected, which could be costly. Another solution is limiting the DERs penetration to the hosting capacity (HC). HC is defined as the maximum DER capacity that can be connected to a given system without violating any technical constraint. Understanding this concept can assist utilities to make percise decisions for interconnection requests and to ensure reliable operation of the system. Traditionally, distribution system operators (DSOs) are reluctant to authorize new DERs’ connections, unless detailed studies are performed. Such studies, however, significantly delay the DER integration and may cause complaints by the DER developers and investors. Hence, a need arises for simplified methodologies that will allow DSOs to assess the network HC in a fast but reliable manner. In this chapter, the HC is formulated as an optimization problem, which can be used in criteria-based HC analysis. We prove that it is not possible to convexify the HC problem by using angle and conic relaxations. Then, we reveal a condition under which the solution of linearized HC model is feasible for the original nonlinear HC problem. Next, we propose a piecewise linear approximation based on the proven condition and separable programming theory.

The power electronic-dominated hybrid AC/DC MG shows a great potential to be an auxiliary of voltage control scheme in distribution network due to the fast response and controllability provided by power electronic technic such as the voltage-source converter (VSC). In this chapter, we incorporate the VSC-based MG into the voltage control scheme of the distribution network by implementing a two-layer control structure. With the distribution network central controller at the upper layer, the tap position of on load tap changer (OLTC), the position of shunt capacitors (SCs) and reactive power injection from MGs are coordinated by solving a multiobjective optimization problem. The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) was applied to solve the problem, and a problem-specified decision-making process was applied after multiple Pareto solutions were obtained. The lower layer lies on the local controllers in each VSC-based hybrid AC/DC MG, which were employed to balance the local power and control the interfaced VSC to inject the amount of power demanded from the upper layer. The proposed voltage control scheme fully utilizes the redundant reactive power of MG to achieve a satisfactory voltage profile along the distribution feeders, while maintaining a good power quality within each MG. It is also promising to reduce the extra investment on voltage regulation devices if the capacity redundancy of MGs can be fully utilized. The simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed voltage control scheme can efficiently improve the steady-state voltage quality while retaining the power quality of each MG.",10.1016/B978-0-12-812154-2.00005-5,1151388,Feng Qiao,Faculty of Engineering,School of Electrical and Information Engineering,Electrical and Information Engineering,Engineering,Electrical engineering,400000,400800,0.942,Engineering,"Electronics, sensors and digital hardware",400000.0,400900.0,0.849,Engineering,"Control engineering, mechatronics and robotics",400000.0,400700.0,0.665,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True

Results show that smartphones not only deliver classification accuracy equal to that of more powerful computers when using the same algorithms, as expected, but also, as many as 75% of the 180 algorithm/dataset learning tasks tested were completed on smartphone hardware within three seconds. However, tests further show that the increased complexity of newer algorithms searching for ever greater classification accuracy is resulting in model-build times growing at an exponential rate. Additional testing identified that while a single algorithm execution can have negligible effect on battery life, power efficiency is affected by algorithm complexity, data size and attribute type. The increased processing demand of local model-learning on smartphones also results in increased power dissipation.

Further, these methods can be applied to almost any decision tree algorithm. To confirm its validity, SPAARC has been tested and compared against an implementation of the CART algorithm using 18 freely-available datasets from the UCI data repository. Results from this testing indicate the two components of SPAARC combined have minimal effect on decision tree classification accuracy yet reduce model build times by as much as 69%.",10.1007/978-981-13-6661-1_4,1137025,Junbin Gao,University of Sydney Business School,Sydney Business School,Business Analytics,Information And Computing Sciences,Software engineering,460000,461200,0.904,Information And Computing Sciences,Other information and computing sciences,460000.0,469900.0,0.845,Information And Computing Sciences,Artificial intelligence,460000.0,460200.0,0.688,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False

Record Linkage is the task of identifying database records referring to the same entity without the aid of definitive key fields. It has applications in data integration, fraud detection and other areas. This involves comparing pairs of records. If done indiscriminately, the size of this task is quadratic in dataset size. Therefore, various indexing methods are typically used to reduce the number of record pairs subjected to detailed comparison. Neighbourhood Blocking generalizes two existing indexing methods – Standard Blocking and Sorted Neighbourhood Indexing. It also allows meaningful treatment of missing values and a limited number of blocking field mismatches. Comparison of the Cartesian product of the blocks is avoided through the use of recursion. Numerical experiments and tests on benchmark datasets are reported in which Neighbourhood Blocking is compared to Standard Blocking and Sorted Neighbourhood Indexing. Under the conditions tested, Neighbourhood Blocking is found to frequently produce superior index quality, often at the expense of increased runtime. Scale testing indicates that index production speeds for Neighbourhood Blocking and Standard Blocking are similar when the database size is sufficiently large.",10.1007/978-3-030-12079-5_5,1018351,Josiah Poon,Faculty of Engineering,School of Computer Science,Computer Science,Information And Computing Sciences,Applied computing,460000,460100,0.675,Information And Computing Sciences,Library and information studies,460000.0,461000.0,0.533,Information And Computing Sciences,Cybersecurity and privacy,460000.0,460400.0,0.513,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False

Social conflicts arise from these different interests such as between landowners seeking to protect private property and those with a passion to ensure public good values are retained. Governments should be in a position to develop legislation that address all these interests in the context of long-term changes to coastal environments driven by natural forces knowing that frequently these forces are modified by human interventions. It is vital for science to have an input into the various stages of adaptive coastal management to ensure the consequences of existing and future human actions do not have adverse environment, social and economic consequences. Scientists should be willing to engage at all these stages from policy, law-making, implementation and enforcement and to monitor outcomes of actions so that in future improvements can be made. Their experience with field observations of coastal change, experiments in coastal processes, and modelling of long-term impacts are seen as important inputs in alerting governments and communities to those likely consequences of operating in a climate changing coastal world.

Yet even when race is centred, the role of settler colonialism as constitutive of racial formation remains marginal, which risks distorting how we see race and racism. By exploring the contemporary application of Australian criminal deportation provisions to exclude Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people who are not Australian citizens, this chapter reveals the foundational and continuing role of “race” and “whiteness” in the formation of Australian sovereignty and citizenship.

However, the ground-truth label of an unlabeled example should be unique, so the existing models inadvertently introduce the label noise which may lead to the biased classifier and deteriorated performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm dubbed as “Positive and Unlabeled learning with Label Disambiguation” (PULD). We first regard all the unlabeled examples in PU learning as ambiguously labeled as positive and negative, and then employ the margin-based label disambiguation strategy, which enlarges the margin of classifier response between the most likely label and the less likely one, to find the unique ground-truth label of each unlabeled example.

Unlike conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer, the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for the influence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore allows for a more informative and intact exploration of the graph structure and further a more effective aggregation of information from distant neighbors into the center node, as compared to node-based GCN methods.

An instance-wise feature pruning is developed by identifying informative features for different instances. Specifically, by investigating a feature decay regularization, we expect intermediate feature maps of each instance in deep neural networks to be sparse while preserving the overall network performance. During online inference, subtle features of input images extracted by intermediate layers of a well-trained neural network can be eliminated to accelerate the subsequent calculations.

We tackle these challenges that hampers the development of CNNs for multi-attribute classification by fully exploiting the correlation between different attributes. The multi-branch architecture is adopted for fucusing on attributes at different regions. Besides the prediction based on each branch itself, context information of each branch are employed for decision as well. The attribute aware pooling is developed to integrate both kinds of information.

Pruning redundant weights directly may hurt global information flow, which suggests that an efficient sparse network should take graph properties into account. Thus, instead of paying more attention to preserving important weight, we focus on the pruned architecture itself. We propose to use graph entropy as the measurement, which shows useful properties to craft high-quality neural graphs and enables us to propose efficient algorithm to construct them as the initial network architecture.

Due to the high variability of nuclei appearances and numerous overlapping objects, this task still remains challenging. Deep learning based semantic and instance segmentation models have been proposed to address the challenges, but these methods tend to concentrate on either the global or local features and hence still suffer from information loss. In this work, we propose a panoptic segmentation model which incorporates an auxiliary semantic segmentation branch with the instance branch to integrate global and local features. Furthermore, we design a feature map fusion mechanism in the instance branch and a new mask generator to prevent information loss.

Early prediction or quantitative evaluation of distant metastases risk for patients with STS is an important step which can provide better-personalized treatments and thereby improve survival rates. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) image is regarded as the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation, staging and assessment of STS. Radiomics, which refers to the extraction and analysis of the quantitative of high-dimensional mineable data from medical images, is foreseen as an important prognostic tool for cancer risk assessment. However, conventional radiomics methods that depend heavily on hand-crafted features (e.g. shape and texture) and prior knowledge (e.g. tuning of many parameters) therefore cannot fully represent the semantic information of the image. In addition, convolutional neural networks (CNN) based radiomics methods present capabilities to improve, but currently, they are mainly designed for single modality e.g., CT or a particular body region e.g., lung structure. In this work, we propose a deep multi-modality collaborative learning to iteratively derive optimal ensembled deep and conventional features from PET-CT images.

This study concerns clearly some of components of M1 regulating motor properties of upper limbs, and holds the neuroscience finding from which the bi-directional causal interaction in brain and muscles has been concluded. The study performs an experiment by which Electromyography (EMG) of limb muscles and Electroencephalography (EEG) across from prefrontal cortex to M1, were synchronously acquired during wrist extensions.

Audio was recorded with a ceiling mounted microphone, simultaneously with full-night polysomnography during sleep. The surrogate measure of the site of airway collapse was identified by manual analysis of the nasal pressure signal. We extracted various time and frequency features of audio signal to classify the signal into 'lateral wall', 'palate' and 'tongue base' related collapse. The classification was carried out with a Gaussian mixture model classifier.

In particular, beyond the topological structure, a more comprehensive method should also incorporate the heterogeneity of various components (i.e. firms and inter-firm links) which together form the SCN. To fill the above gap, this work proposes using the idea of absorbing Markov chains to model disruption impacts on SCNs.

Background: Eating behaviours are subjective constructs representing physiological need and the hedonic need to eat. After metabolic surgery, eating behaviours have been observed to change. Little is known about whether eating behaviour change differs according to the metabolic procedure performed. Design: Adults (n = 204) with severe obesity from three countries were followed 1 year after metabolic surgical procedures (n = 121). Methods: We measured eating behaviours using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire and used linear mixed models to compare eating behaviours within and between three procedure groups. We complied with the STROBE checklist for reporting observational studies. Results: Within groups, there were statistically significant increases in restraint and decreases in disinhibition and hunger. Between groups, we observed differences in disinhibition associated with the band procedure. There were no significant differences between any group for body weight or body mass index a year post-surgery. Disinhibition was the only eating behaviour associated with body weight, body mass index and the per cent of weight loss. Conclusions: Eating behaviours in adults with severe obesity who underwent any of the three metabolic procedures were associated with eating behaviour change 1 year post-surgery. Disinhibition was the only eating behaviour that was associated with body weight. Relevance to clinical practice: Irrespective of the procedure, we found participants had a statistically significant increase in restraint and decreases in disinhibition and hunger 1 year post-surgery. Despite the significant reduction in disinhibition within the band group, this behaviour was more pronounced post-surgery compared with other groups. Although the reduction in hunger showed the greatest change, it was not associated with weight outcomes. This is relevant clinical knowledge for nurses who support bariatric surgical patients.",10.1111/jocn.15847,1134230,Narelle Margaret Story,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Nursing School,Faculty of Nursing & Midwifery,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Nutrition and dietetics,320000,321000,0.665,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.641,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Other biomedical and clinical sciences,320000.0,329900.0,0.593,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Drawing on three case studies of restructured cultural organisations in Australia and New Zealand, Robinson provides valuable insights into the conceptual and practical ways in which hybridised collecting institutions operate. Reflecting on the ultimate value of converged institutions for the communities they serve, the book uncovers the dangers of misalignment between bureaucratic decision-making and the creation of cultural meaning. Actively contesting policy assumptions about the benefits of integrating museums with other kinds of cultural institutions, the book's analysis of empirical evidence provides an important counterbalance by exposing the impacts of supposedly benign structural changes to museum organisations on fundamental processes of research, documentation and contextualisation of collections. Interpreting Objects in the Hybrid Museumhighlights the consequences of policy decisions on the distinctive interpretive role of museums. As such, the book should be of interest to a range of academic and professional audiences, including scholars and students in the fields of museum and heritage studies, library and archival science, cultural studies and politics.

Yet priceless cultural collections, amassed over many decades, are in danger of languishing without ever finding reconnection to the individuals and communities of their origin. The extensive documentary heritage of Australian Indigenous peoples is dispersed, and in many cases participants in the creation of archival records, or their descendants, have little idea of where to find these records. These processes of casting memories of the past into the future bring various conundrums of a social, political, and technical nature. They raise questions about the nature and dynamics of ongoing cultural transmission, the role of institutional and community archives in both protecting records of languages, song, and social history and disseminating them, and the responsibilities of researchers, organisations, and end users in this complex intercultural space. These questions are perforce framed by ethical and legal questions about access, competing ideas of ownership, and shifting community protocols surrounding rights of access to and the dissemination of cultural information. This paper arises from a project designed to reintegrate such research collections of Central Australian cultural knowledge with the places and communities from which they originally emanated. While we show that the issues raised are seldom neutral and often complex, we also argue for the power that culturally appropriate mobilisation of archival materials has for those that inherit the knowledge they embody.",,1017973,Linda Barwick,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,PARADISEC,Information And Computing Sciences,Library and information studies,460000,461000,0.774,Information And Computing Sciences,Other information and computing sciences,460000.0,469900.0,0.77,Information And Computing Sciences,Data management and data science,460000.0,460500.0,0.611,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Wanji-wanji was once a popular entertainment song that was performed across the western half of Australia, as can be seen by the many recordings of it held in archives. Custodianship of the song is unknown; the earliest reference to its performance dates back to the 1850s, where it is described as a ‘travelling dance’ (Bates 1913–1914) and so in terms of copyright its status may be comparable to ‘public domain’, i.e. outside of copyright. Responses to hearing the recording were emotional. Those who knew the song recalled the place and time in which they had heard it long ago. There was great interest in how widely it was known though little interest in the meanings of the lyrics. On the whole, responses to access and proposed uses of the recordings, as well as the future possible uses of the song, reflected its public domain status. Nevertheless, the confidence in people’s responses varied depending on whether the individual knew the song, had experience in using archival recordings, and whether they perceived community interest and support for classical Aboriginal singing practices.",,1006064,Myfany Turpin,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,PARADISEC,Creative Arts And Writing,Music,360000,360300,0.966,Creative Arts And Writing,Creative and professional writing,360000.0,360200.0,0.886,Indigenous Studies,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, language and history",450000.0,450100.0,0.858,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,True

In this model the turbulence is highly anisotropic with preferred directions imposed by the Earth's rotation and the magnetic field. Current geodynamo computations effectively model sub-grid scale turbulence by using isotropic viscous and thermal diffusion values significantly greater than the molecular values of the Earth's core. We consider a local turbulent dynamo model for the Earth's core in which the mean magnetic field, velocity and temperature satisfy the Boussinesq induction, momentum and heat equations with an isotropic turbulent Ekman number and Roberts number. The anisotropy is modelled only in the thermal diffusion tensor with the Earth's rotation and magnetic field as preferred directions. Nonlocal organising effects of gravity and rotation (but not aspect ratio in the Earth's core) such as an inverse cascade and nonlocal transport are assumed to occur at longer length scales, which computations may accurately capture with sufficient resolution. To investigate the implications of this anisotropy for the proposed turbulent dynamo model we investigate the linear instability of turbulent magnetoconvection on length scales longer than the background turbulence in a rotating sphere with electrically insulating exterior for no-slip and isothermal boundary conditions. The equations are linearised about an axisymmetric basic state with a conductive temperature, azimuthal magnetic field and differential rotation. The basic state temperature is a function of the anisotropy and the spherical radius. Elsasser numbers in the range 1–20 and turbulent Roberts numbers 0.01–1 are considered for both equatorial symmetries of the magnetic basic state. It is found that anisotropic turbulent thermal diffusivity has a strong destabilising effect on magneto-convective instabilities, which may relax the tight energy budget constraining geodynamo models. The enhanced instability is not due to a reduction of the total diffusivity. The anisotropy also strengthens instabilities which break the symmetry of the underlying state, which may facilitate magnetic field reversal. Geostrophic flow appears to suppress the symmetry breaking modes and magnetic instabilities. Through symmetry breaking and the geostrophic flow the anisotropy may provide a mechanism of magnetic field reversal and its suppression in computational dynamo models.",10.1016/j.pepi.2017.08.007,1000900,David Ivers,Faculty of Science,School of Mathematics and Statistics,Mathematics & Statistics,Earth Sciences,Geophysics,370000,370600,0.803,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

Badlands is a landscape evolution model that simulates topography development at various space and time scales. Badlands consists of a number of geophysical parameters that needs estimation with appropriate uncertainty quantification; given the observed present-day ground truth such as surface topography and the stratigraphy of sediment deposition through time. The inference of the unknown parameters is challenging due to the scarcity of data, sensitivity of the parameter setting, and complexity of the model. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to provide inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC). We present Bayeslands; a Bayesian framework for Badlands that fuses information obtained from complex forward models with observational data and prior knowledge. As a proof-of-concept, we consider a synthetic and real-world topography with two parameters for Bayeslands; namely, precipitation and erodibility. We demonstrate the challenge in sampling irregular and multi-modal posterior distributions using a likelihood surface that has a range of sub-optimal modes.

This is, to our knowledge, the first parameterised algorithm in computational 3-manifold topology using a topological parameter. The computation of TV 4,q is known to be #P-hard in general; using a topological parameter provides an algorithm polynomial in the size of the input triangulation for the family of 3-manifolds with first Z2-homology group of bounded dimension. Our algorithm is easy to implement, and running times are comparable with running times to compute integral homology groups for standard libraries of triangulated 3-manifolds. The invariants we can compute this way are powerful: in combination with integral homology and using standard data sets, we are able to almost double the pairs of 3-manifolds we can distinguish.

The cell surface is described by a previously reported quartic equation in three dimensional (3D) Cartesian space. Using recently available functions in Mathematica to triangularize the surfaces we computed four types of curvature of the membrane. We also mapped changes in mesh-triangle area and curvatures as the RBCs were distorted. The highly deformable red blood cell (erythrocyte; RBC) responds to mechanically imposed shape changes with enhanced glycolytic flux and cation transport. Such morphological changes are produced experimentally by suspending the cells in a gelatin gel, which is then elongated or compressed in a custom apparatus inside an NMR spectrometer. A key observation is the extent to which the maximum and minimum Principal Curvatures are localized symmetrically in patches at the poles or equators and distributed in rings around the main axis of the strained RBC. Changes on the nanometre to micro-meter scale of curvature, suggest activation of only a subset of the intrinsic mechanosensitive cation channels, Piezo1, during experiments carried out with controlled distortions, which persist for many hours. This finding is relevant to a proposal for non-uniform distribution of Piezo1 molecules around the RBC membrane. However, if the curvature that gates Piezo1 is at a very fine length scale, then membrane tension will determine local curvature; so, curvatures as computed here (in contrast to much finer surface irregularities) may not influence Piezo1 activity. Nevertheless, our analytical methods can be extended address these new mechanistic proposals. The geometrical reorganization of the simulated cytoskeleton informs ideas about the mechanism of concerted metabolic and cation-flux responses of the RBC to mechanically imposed shape changes.",10.1038/s41598-021-92699-7,1000789,Philip Kuchel,Faculty of Science,School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),Biological Sciences,Biochemistry and cell biology,310000,310100,0.763,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Cardiovascular medicine and haematology,320000.0,320100.0,0.549,,,,,,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

The MOOC was conceived holistically, contributing towards improving diversity and inclusion, creating opportunities for participants throughout the world, including those from regions suffering from political or economic instability. The MOOC facilitates pathways towards higher education through greater awareness of mathematics and its usefulness. This became acutely relevant for students facing disruptions from COVID-19 and forced into remote learning. Historical narratives permeate the MOOC, providing students with perspectives that they might not see in typical classrooms or textbooks. The MOOC alleviates frustration from students who have difficulty navigating online material or who have had negative experiences in learning mathematics.

Thus, to inform climate change mitigation and adaptation, we quantified the mortality burden of historical heatwave days in Sydney, Australia, assessed the contribution of the UHI effect and used climate change projection data to estimate future health impacts. We also assessed the potential for tree cover to mitigate against the UHI effect. Mortality (2006–2018) records were linked with census population data, weather observations (1997–2016) and climate change projections to 2100. Heatwave-attributable excess deaths were calculated based on risk estimates from a published heatwave study of Sydney. High resolution satellite observations of UHI air temperature excesses and green cover were used to determine associated effects on heat-related mortality. These data show that >90% of heatwave days would not breach heatwave thresholds in Sydney if there were no UHI effect and that numbers of heatwave days could increase fourfold under the most extreme climate change scenario. We found that tree canopy reduces urban heat, and that widespread tree planting could offset the increases in heat-attributable deaths as climate warming progresses.",10.3390/atmos13050714,1170126,Christy Geromboux,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Public Health,School of Public Health: Medicine,Environmental Sciences,Climate change impacts and adaptation,410000,410100,0.923,Earth Sciences,Climate change science,370000.0,370200.0,0.916,Earth Sciences,Atmospheric sciences,370000.0,370100.0,0.88,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

However, these health improvements could be outweighed by harm from inhaling traffic-related air pollutants during AM participation. The interaction of AM and air pollutants on health is complex physiologically, manifesting as acute changes in health indicators that may lead to poor long-term health consequences. The aim of this study was to systematically review the current evidence of effect modification by air pollution (AP) on associations between AM and health indicators. Studies were included if they examined associations between AM and health indicators being modified by AP or, conversely, associations between AP and health indicators being modified by AM. Thirty-three studies met eligibility criteria. The main AP indicators studied were particulate matter, ultrafine particles, and nitrogen oxides. Most health indicators studied were grouped into cardiovascular and respiratory indicators. There is evidence of a reduction by AP, mainly ultrafine particles and PM2.5, in the short-term health benefits of AM. Multiple studies suggest that long-term health benefits of AM are not negatively associated with levels of the single traffic-related pollutant NO2. However, other studies reveal reduced long-term health benefits of AM in areas affected by high levels of pollutant mixtures. We recommend that future studies adopt consistent and rigorous study designs and include reporting of interaction testing, to advance understanding of the complex relationships between AM, AP, and health indicators.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157978,1176202,Melissa Haswell,DVC Indigenous Strategy and Services,DVC Indigenous Strategy and Services,Office of the DVC (Indigenous Strategy and Services),Environmental Sciences,Environmental management,410000,410400,0.9,Environmental Sciences,Pollution and contamination,410000.0,410500.0,0.89,Health Sciences,Public health,420000.0,420600.0,0.876,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True

However, pregnant women have limited knowledge about maternal oral health and seldom seek dental care. Further, due to limited training antenatal care providers like midwives rarely discuss oral health with pregnant women. The Midwifery-Initiated Oral Health Dental Service program was developed to address current gaps in oral promotional interventions during pregnancy. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of a Midwifery-Initiated Oral Health Dental Service program in improving uptake of dental services, oral health knowledge, quality of oral health, oral health status and birth outcomes of pregnant women. Design: Multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Setting: Three large metropolitan public hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Participants: Pregnant women attending their first antenatal appointment who were at least 18 years old and had a single low risk pregnancy between 12 and 20 weeks gestation. Methods: 638 pregnant women were allocated to three groups using block randomisation (n = 211) control group, intervention group 1 (n = 215), intervention group 2 (n = 212) and followed up till birth. Study investigators and data collectors were blinded to group allocation. Intervention group 1 received a midwifery intervention from trained midwives involving oral health education, screening and referrals to existing dental pathways. Intervention group 2 received the midwifery intervention and a dental intervention involving assessment/treatment from cost free local dental services. The control group received oral health information at recruitment. Primary outcome was uptake of dental services. Secondary outcomes included oral health knowledge, quality of oral health, oral health status and birth outcomes. Results: Substantial improvements in the use of dental services (20.2% Control Group; 28.3% Intervention group 1; 87.2% Intervention group 2; Odds Ratio Intervention group 2 vs Control Group = 29.72, 95% CI 15.02–58.53, p < 0.001), women's oral health knowledge (p = 0.03); quality of oral health (p < 0.001) and oral health outcomes (sulcus bleeding, dental plaque, clinical attachment loss, decayed/filled teeth- p < 0.001) were found in Intervention group 2. No difference in the rate of preterm or low-birth weight was found. Conclusions: The Midwifery-Initiated Oral Health Dental Service program (Intervention group 2) improved the uptake of dental services and oral health of pregnant women and is recommended during antenatal care.

We aimed to generate reliable and robust evidence of this relationship based on date of onset of symptoms. We evaluated important meteorological factors associated with daily COVID-19 counts and effective reproduction number (Rt) in China using a two-stage approach with overdispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analysis. Spatial heterogeneity and stratified analyses by sex and age groups were quantified and potential effect modification was analyzed. Nationwide, there was no evidence that temperature and relative humidity affected COVID-19 incidence and Rt. However, there were heterogeneous impacts on COVID-19 risk across different regions. Importantly, there was a negative association between relative humidity and COVID-19 incidence in Central China: a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 3.92% (95% CI, 1.98%–5.82%) decrease in daily counts. Older population appeared to be more sensitive to meteorological conditions, but there was no obvious difference between sexes. Linear relationships were found between meteorological variables and COVID-19 incidence. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the association and the results based on report date were biased.

These results demonstrate exposure differences in both magnitude and PFAS profiles for N. cinerea in South Australia and A. p. doriferus in Victoria. This study reports detectable PFAS concentrations in Australian pinniped pups indicating the importance of maternal transfer of these toxicants.

This complexity makes them difficult to conceptualize, requiring frameworks to organize the different program components. Evaluation frameworks that unpack the sequence of events linking program activities to outcomes (e.g., Theory of Change) and track outcomes (e.g., Outcome Mapping) show promise in supporting the development of One Health programs. While widely used in international development and health contexts, there has been little reflection on the use of Theory of Change and Outcome Mapping within One Health efforts. This paper reflects on the process of applying these frameworks to conceptualize a One Health food safety program in Vietnam. We find Theory of Change fostered the characterization of a change pathway toward safer pork, while Outcome Mapping kept us informed of where along the change pathway we were.

This has created a debate over which urban form can more effectively lead to lower household carbon footprints (CF). Previous suburban-scale studies using economic input-output life cycle assessment with national average carbon intensities have demonstrated the mitigation potentials in households via urban planning. However, there is a need for suburban-scale multiregional input-output (MRIO) tables to model suburb-specific carbon intensities and thus to account for the heterogeneity of both production and consumption in different suburbs. This study explores the case of Sydney, Australia, and its many suburbs. The CF of households is broken down into 111 sectors and 248 spatial divisions of Greater Sydney by employing a suburban-scale MRIO model. The impact of domestic and overseas migration on household CFs is modelled during 2009–2010, and the CFs are allocated to different ethnic groups. The results suggest that residents in the densely populated city core have a comparable CF to residents living in outer city suburbs, thus contradicting previous studies supporting the notion that densely populated inner-city areas yield relatively lower CFs. The rapid growth of population increases household CFs in inner western suburbs. According to the study findings, the ongoing Sydney metropolitan development plan may therefore not be sufficient to provide a sustainable carbon emissions reduction strategy, if suburb density is increased without any constraints on resident consumption patterns. Urban planners need to consider policies to direct the investment brought by immigration towards a lower-carbon economy and infrastructure and also may take advantage of the sharing economy to change consumption behaviour.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.161,1122709,Thomas Wiedmann,Faculty of Science,School of Physics,Physics,Earth Sciences,Climate change science,370000,370200,0.877,Environmental Sciences,Climate change impacts and adaptation,410000.0,410100.0,0.771,Environmental Sciences,Environmental management,410000.0,410400.0,0.729,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The aims of this study were to (a) characterize the MRI signal properties of a photopolymer resin that can be 3D printed, (b) develop multicompartment phantoms based on the resin, and (c) demonstrate the feasibility of using these phantoms to mimic human anatomy in the assessment of UTE sequences. Methods: A photopolymer resin (Prismlab China Ltd, Shanghai, China) was imaged on a 3 Tesla MRI system (Siemens Skyra) to characterize its MRI properties with emphasis on T2 - signal and longevity. Two anthropomorphic phantoms, using the 3D printed resin to simulate skeletal anatomy, were developed and imaged using UTE sequences. A skull phantom was developed and used to assess the feasibility of using the resin to develop a complex model with realistic morphological human characteristics. A tibia model was also developed to assess the suitability of the resin at mimicking a simple multicompartment anatomical model and imaged using a three-dimensional UTE sequence (PETRA). Image quality measurements of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast factor were calculated and these were compared to in vivo values. Results: The T2 - and T1 (mean ± standard deviation) of the photopolymer resin was found to be 411 ± 19 ?s and 74.39 ± 13.88 ms, respectively, and demonstrated no statistically significant change during 4 months of monitoring. The resin had a similar T2 - decay to human cortical bone; however, had lower T1 properties. The bone water concentration of the resin was 59% relative to an external water reference phantom, and this was higher than in vivo values reported for human cortical bone. The multicompartment anthropomorphic head phantom was successfully produced and able to simulate realistic air cavities, bony anatomy, and soft tissue. Image quality assessment in the tibia phantom using the PETRA sequence showed the suitability of the resin to mimic human anatomy with high SNR and contrast making it suitable for tissue segmentation. Conclusions: A solid resin material, which can be 3D printed, has been found to have similar magnetic resonance signal properties to human cortical bone. Phantoms replicating skeletal anatomy were successfully produced using this resin and demonstrated their use for image quality and segmentation assessment of ultrashort echo time sequences.",10.1002/mp.12727,1009063,Lois Holloway,Faculty of Science,School of Physics,Physics,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Medical biotechnology,320000,320600,0.663,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Neurosciences,320000.0,320900.0,0.566,Engineering,Biomedical engineering,400000.0,400300.0,0.54,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Methods: The data of 25,789 test-day milk yield and milk composition records of 1,468 cattle from lactation 1 to 3 of Holstein Friesian (HF) and crossbred HF dairy cattle calved between 1990 and 2015 from three government research farms in Thailand were analysed. 305-day milk yield was estimated by the Wood model and a test interval method. The Wood model was used for estimating cumulative 305-day milk yield, peak milk yield, days to peak milk yield and persistency. Genetic parameters were estimated using linear mixed models with herd, breed group, year and season of calving as fixed effects, and animals linked to a pedigree as random effects, together with a residual error. Univariate models were used to estimate variance components, heritability, estimated breeding values (EBVs) and repeatability of each trait, while pairwise bivariate models were used to estimate covariance components and correlations between traits in the same lactation and in the same trait across lactations. Results: The heritability of 305-day milk yield, peak milk yield and protein percentage have moderate to high estimates ranging from 0.19 to 0.45 while days to peak milk yield, persistency and fat percentage have low heritability ranging from 0.08 to 0.14 in lactation 1 cows. Further, heritability of most traits considered was higher in lactation 1 compared with lactations 2 and 3. For cows in lactation 1, high genetic correlations were found between 305-day milk yield and peak milk yield (0.86±0.07) and days to peak milk yield and persistency (0.99±0.02) while estimates of genetic correlations between the remaining traits were imprecise due to the high standard errors. The genetic correlations within the traits across lactation were high. There was no consistent trend of EBVs for most traits in the first lactation over the study period. Conclusion: Both the Wood model and test interval method can be used for milk yield estimates in these herds. However, the Wood model has advantages over the test interval method as it can be fitted using fewer test-day records and the estimated model parameters can be used to derive estimates of other lactation curve parameters. Milk yield, peak milk yield and protein percentage can be improved by a selection and mating program while days to peak milk yield, persistency and fat percentage can be improved by including into a selection index.",10.5713/ab.21.0559,450090390,Santi Pangmao,Faculty of Science,School of Veterinary Science,Veterinary Science,Biological Sciences,Genetics,310000,310500,0.977,Biological Sciences,Zoology,310000.0,310900.0,0.893,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

There has been impressive adoption in Australia of a farmer-applied spray-on topical anaesthetic wound formulation (TAF; Tri-Solfen®, Medical Ethics, Australia), initially for managing pain of the breech modification ‘mulesing’ procedure that reduces susceptibility of sheep to flystrike. Over 120 million lambs have now received pain relief and cattle producers have commenced using the TAF for a range of husbandry procedures. This product has demonstrated efficacy for surgical castration and tail docking of lambs, surgical castration and dehorning of calves, surgical castration of piglets, debridement of lesions of the hoof for lame cattle and, importantly, treatment of clinical FMD lesions, including decubitus ulcerations occurring from prolonged recumbency. Multimodal use of an NSAID for improved pain management is advocated, particularly meloxicam, available by prescription from veterinarians for injection and as an oral formulation (Ilium Buccalgesic®, Troy Laboratories, Australia), with current work assessing the potential for prolonged delivery in molasses blocks.

Yoyetta corindi n. sp. has a restricted, coastal and subcoastal warm temperate distribution in north-eastern New South Wales open forest communities between Trustums Hill and Arrawarra, extending inland from south-west of Grafton to Tyringham. Yoyetta delicata n. sp. has an inland warm temperate distribution in eucalypt woodland and open forest from near Killarney and west of Warwick in south-east Queensland south to Cassilis and near Wyong in central New South Wales. Yoyetta ignita n. sp. is found from Flinders Peak and Mt Tamborine in southeast Queensland, south along the Great Dividing Range (and inland to Mt Kaputar) in New South Wales, with a disjunct population on the eastern slopes of Mt Ainslie in the Australian Capital Territory. Yoyetta robusta n. sp. is found from the Granite Belt in south-east Queensland south to the Glenn Innes area in northern New South Wales.

The effects of PIII treatment on the optical properties, chemical structure, crystallinity, morphology, gel fraction formation and wettability were investigated. As in the case of a number of previously studied polymers, oxidation and hydrophobic recovery of the PIII treated PCL follow second order kinetics. CAPA 6250, which has the lowest molecular weight and the highest degree of crystallinity of the untreated PCL films studied, has the highest carbonization of the modified layer after PIII treatment. Untreated medical grade PCL films, mPCL PC12 (Perstorp) and mPCL OsteoporeTM have similar chemical structures and crystallinity. Accordingly, the chemical and structural transformations caused by PIII treatment and post-treatment oxidation are almost identical for these two polymers. In general, PIII treatment destroys the nano-scale lamellar structure and results in a reduction of PCL crystallinity. Examination after washing PIII treated PCL films in toluene confirmed our hypothesis that cross-linking due to PIII treatment is significantly higher in semi-crystalline PCL as compared with amorphous polymers.",10.1007/s10856-017-6009-1,1138117,Elena Kosobrodova,Faculty of Science,School of Physics,Physics,Chemical Sciences,Macromolecular and materials chemistry,340000,340300,0.797,Chemical Sciences,Organic chemistry,340000.0,340500.0,0.79,Chemical Sciences,Inorganic chemistry,340000.0,340200.0,0.701,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Such biased noise, where dephasing dominates, is ubiquitous in many quantum architectures. In the limit of pure dephasing noise we find a threshold of 43.7(1)% using a tensor network decoder proposed by Bravyi, Suchara, and Vargo. The threshold remains surprisingly large in the regime of realistic noise bias ratios, for example 28.2(2)% at a bias of 10. The performance is, in fact, at or near the hashing bound for all values of the bias. The modified surface code still uses only weight-4 stabilizers on a square lattice, but merely requires measuring products of Y instead of Z around the faces, as this doubles the number of useful syndrome bits associated with the dominant Z errors.

We aimed to measure the carbon footprint of Australia's health-care system. Methods: We did an observational economic input–output lifecycle assessment of Australia's health-care system. All expenditure data were obtained from the 15 sectors of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare for the financial year 2014–15. The Australian Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab) data were used to obtain CO2e emissions per AUS$ spent on health care. Findings: In 2014–15 Australia spent $161·6 billion on health care that led to CO2e emissions of about 35 772 (68% CI 25 398–46 146) kilotonnes. Australia's total CO2e emissions in 2014–15 were 494 930 kilotonnes, thus health care represented 35 772 (7%) of 494 930 kilotonnes total CO2e emissions in Australia. The five most important sectors within health care in decreasing order of total CO2e emissions were: public hospitals (12 295 [34%] of 35 772 kilotonnes CO2e), private hospitals (3635 kilotonnes [10%]), other medications (3347 kilotonnes [9%]), benefit-paid drugs (3257 kilotonnes [9%]), and capital expenditure for buildings (2776 kilotonnes [8%]). Interpretation: The carbon footprint attributed to health care was 7% of Australia's total; with hospitals and pharmaceuticals the major contributors. We quantified Australian carbon footprint attributed to health care and identified health-care sectors that could be ameliorated.

The City of Johannesburg - one of South Africa's metropolitan municipalities and also a health district - has over 600,000 people living with HIV (PLHIV), more than any other city worldwide. We estimate what it would take in terms of programmatic targets and costs for the City of Johannesburg to meet the Fast-Track targets, and demonstrate the impact that this would have. Methods: We applied the Optima HIV epidemic and resource allocation model to demographic, epidemiological and behavioural data on 26 sub-populations in Johannesburg. We used data on programme costs and coverage to produce baseline projections. We calculated how many people must be diagnosed, put onto treatment and maintained with viral suppression to achieve the 2020 and 2030 targets. We also estimated how treatment needs - and therefore fiscal commitments - could be reduced if the treatment targets are combined with primary HIV prevention interventions (voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), an expanded condom programme, and comprehensive packages for female sex workers (FSW) and young females). Results: If current programmatic coverage were maintained, Johannesburg could expect 303,000 new infections and 96,000 AIDS-related deaths between 2017 and 2030 and 769,000 PLHIV by 2030. Achieving the Fast-Track targets would require an additional 135,000 diagnoses and 232,000 people on treatment by 2020 (an increase in around 80% over 2016 treatment numbers), but would avert 176,000 infections and 56,500 deaths by 2030. Assuming stable ART unit costs, this would require ZAR 29 billion (USD 2.15 billion) in cumulative treatment investments over the 14 years to 2030. Plausible scale-ups of other proven interventions (VMMC, condom distribution and FSW strategies) could yield additional reductions in new infections (between 4 and 15%), and in overall treatment investment needs. Scaling up VMMC in line with national targets is found to be cost-effective in the medium term. Conclusions: The scale-up in testing and treatment programmes over this decade has been rapid, but these efforts must be doubled to reach 2020 targets. Strategic investments in proven interventions will help Johannesburg achieve the treatment targets and be on track to end AIDS by 2030.",10.1002/jia2.25068,1039409,Cliff Kerr,Faculty of Science,School of Physics,Physics,Health Sciences,Public health,420000,420600,0.221,Mathematical Sciences,Numerical and computational mathematics,490000.0,490300.0,0.211,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Herein, we propose a mathematical model based on a positive feedback loop of BDNF expression and signaling to investigate PVT manipulation of synaptic potentiation. The model is validated by comparisons with experimental observations. We find that a high postsynaptic firing frequency after stimulation is induced by presynaptic Ca 2 + when the rates of BDNF secretion from PVT and LA neurons to the CeL are above a threshold value. Moreover, the positive feedback of postsynaptic BDNF production is important for the maintenance of the high excitability of the SOM + CeL neuron after stimulation.

This compound is known to adsorb gasses and carbon, participate in biological redox reactions and provide habitat biofilms for desirable microbiota proliferation.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hardwood biochar supplementation on fermentation parameters, methane (CH4) production and the ruminal archaeal, bacterial, and fungal microbiota using the in vitro RUSITEC (rumen simulation technique) system. Treatments consisted of a control diet (oaten pasture: maize silage: concentrate, 35:35:30 w/w) and hardwood biochar included at 400 or 800 mg per day (3.6 and 7.2% of substrate DM, respectively), over a 15-day period. Biochar supplementation had no effect (P ? 0.37) on pH, effluent (mL/d), total gas (mL/d), dry matter (DM) digestibility or CH4 production (mg/d). The addition of 800 mg biochar per day had the tendency (P = 0.10) to lower the % of CH4 released in fermentation compared to 400 mg/d biochar treatment. However, no effect (P ? 0.44) was seen on total VFA, acetate, propionate, butyric, branched-chain VFA, valerate and caproate production and the ratio of acetate to propionate. No effect (P > 0.05) was observed on bacterial, archaeal or fungal community structure.

Consisting of two leaflets of amphipathic molecules, the bilayer membrane forms an impermeable barrier to ions and small molecules. Controlled transport of molecules across lipid membranes is a fundamental biological process that is facilitated by a diverse range of membrane proteins, including ion-channels and pores. However, biological membranes and their associated proteins are challenging to experimentally characterize. These challenges have motivated recent advances in nanotechnology towards building and manipulating synthetic lipid systems. Liposomes—aqueous droplets enclosed by a bilayer membrane—can be synthesised in vitro and used as a synthetic model for the cell membrane. In DNA nanotechnology, DNA is used as programmable building material for self-assembling biocompatible nanostructures. DNA nanostructures can be functionalised with hydrophobic chemical modifications, which bind to or bridge lipid membranes. Here, we review approaches that combine techniques from lipid and DNA nanotechnology to engineer the topography, permeability, and surface interactions of membranes, and to direct the fusion and formation of liposomes. These approaches have been used to study the properties of membrane proteins, to build biosensors, and as a pathway towards assembling synthetic multicellular systems.",10.3390/genes10121001,T22291,Jasleen Daljit Singh,Faculty of Engineering,School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering,Chemical Sciences,Macromolecular and materials chemistry,340000,340300,0.52,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

Neoliberalization has proven a flexible, adaptive and renewable pattern of reform. At the same time, there is increasing evidence for Harvey’s contention that its principal socio-economic outcome is inequality. Accordingly, this article proposes that contextualized understandings of neoliberal formations may shed some light on how inegalitarian upwards redistribution has come to pass. It focuses on the Australian government of John Howard (1996–2007), arguing that its fiscal policies created an ‘investor state’ – a uniquely generous and expensive system of tax cuts and state subsidy for investors and consumers of private welfare services. This fulfilled the general neoliberal imperative to boost markets in a locally adapted way that built on the market liberalization of the previous Hawke and Keating governments. Importantly, however, it also altered the generous welfare system they had established, redirecting state support away from those most in need towards those with capital.",10.1177/0896920517745117,1101433,Guy Redden,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Humanities,Discipline of Gender and Cultural Studies,Economics,Economic theory,380000,380300,0.835,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

Marind children become ‘anim' (persons) by immersing themselves within the ecology of sago palms and their suckers, or ‘sago children’. Conversely, deforestation and oil palm expansion – the defining traits of the place, period, and production mode I term ‘Papuan Plantationocene’ – subvert the mutual maturation of humans and sago by confining children to the oppressive environment of the village and preventing them from supporting sago's growth through sago transplanting and felling. Meanwhile, oil palm itself is alternately characterized by Marind as a vulnerable child subjected to totalizing human control and as a figure of hope for future Marind generations. The article provides a deeper and broader consideration of ‘childhood’ beyond the human in understanding how monocrop capitalist production reconfigures the form and possibility of multispecies social reproduction for people and plants.",10.1111/1467-9655.13489,1168623,Sophie Chao,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Social and Political Sciences,Discipline of Anthropology,Biological Sciences,Plant biology,310000,310800,0.833,Biological Sciences,Ecology,310000.0,310300.0,0.601,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

In the study reported here, we sought to shed light on these issues by using 3D shape analysis techniques to compare the cranial bases of Anglo-Saxon skeletons to those of skeletons from Great Britain that pre-date the Early Medieval period and skeletons from Denmark that date to the Iron Age. Analyses that focused on Early Anglo-Saxon skeletons indicated that between twothirds and three-quarters of Anglo-Saxon individuals were of continental northwest Europe ancestry, while between a quarter and one-third were of local ancestry. In contrast, analyses that focused on Middle Anglo-Saxon skeletons suggested that 50-70% were of local ancestry, while 30-50% were of continental northwest Europe ancestry. Our study suggests, therefore, that ancestry in Early Medieval Britain was similar to what it is today-mixed and mutable.

It has been argued that these conditions enabled population growth that became unsustainable following the onset of a cold-arid phase ca. 3000 BP, with these cycles of growth and collapse again repeating ca. 2000 and 1000 BP. Here we present multi-proxy palynomorph, charcoal and sediment data indicating that from ca. 4500-1500 BP the environment of the valley was characterised by drier conditions, comparable to other regional records indicating weakening Westerly precipitation over Central Asia. Considering recent archaeobotanical data indicating the presence of both West Asian winter crops and East Asian summer millets in the valley as early as 4500 BP, we argue that rather than Malthusian cycles of growth and collapse in Kashmir, early populations likely drew on a broad range of available domesticates and varied ecotopes across the valley to allow a Boserupian response to changing Holocene climate conditions. These adaptations were likely more oriented towards flexible systems of agro-pastoralism practiced throughout the Inner Asian mountains, rather than towards developing large urban settlements as was the case in the river basins and plains south of Kashmir.",10.1016/j.quaint.2021.07.014,1135200,Michael Spate,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Humanities,Discipline of Archaeology,"History, Heritage And Archaeology",Archaeology,430000,430100,0.975,"History, Heritage And Archaeology",Historical studies,430000.0,430300.0,0.84,"History, Heritage And Archaeology","Other history, heritage and archaeology",430000.0,439900.0,0.813,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True

Future progress in understanding brain function using these methods will require addressing a number of key methodological and interpretive challenges. Because these challenges often remain unseen and metaphorically “haunt” our efforts to use these methods to understand the brain, we refer to them as “ghosts”. In this paper, we describe three such ghosts, situate them within a more general framework from philosophy of science, and then describe steps to address them. The first ghost arises from difficulties in determining what information machine learning classifiers use for decoding. The second ghost arises from the interplay of experimental design and the structure of information in the brain – that is, our methods embody implicit assumptions about information processing in the brain, and it is often difficult to determine if those assumptions are satisfied. The third ghost emerges from our limited ability to distinguish information that is merely decodable from the brain from information that is represented and used by the brain. Each of the three ghosts place limits on the interpretability of decoding research in cognitive neuroscience. There are no easy solutions, but facing these issues squarely will provide a clearer path to understanding the nature of representation and computation in the human brain.",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.019,1152079,Thomas Carlson,Faculty of Science,School of Psychology,Psychology,Information And Computing Sciences,Machine learning,460000,461100,0.868,Information And Computing Sciences,Artificial intelligence,460000.0,460200.0,0.722,Information And Computing Sciences,Data management and data science,460000.0,460500.0,0.681,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

However, controversy exists as to what it means to be autonomous and there is limited understanding of how social and structural factors may influence cancer patients’ ability to exercise their autonomy. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore oncologists’ and palliative care physicians’ understanding of patient autonomy, how this influences reported enactment of decision-making at the end of life (EOL), and the role of ACP in EOL care. Design and setting: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with consultant oncologists (n = 11) and palliative medicine doctors (n = 7) working in oncology centres and palliative care units across Australia. Results: We found that doctors generally conceptualized autonomy in terms of freedom from interference but that there was a profound disconnect between this understanding of autonomy and clinical practice in EOL decision-making. The clinicians in our study privileged care, relationships and a ‘good death’ above patient autonomy, and in practice were reluctant to ‘abandon’ their patients to total non-interference in decision-making. Patient autonomy in healthcare is bounded, as while patients were generally encouraged to express their preferences for care, medical norms about the quality and ‘reasonableness’ of care, the availability of services and the patients’ family relationships act to enhance or limit patients’ capacity to realize their preferences. While for many, this disconnect between theory and practice did not diminish the rhetorical appeal of ACP; for others, this undermined the integrity of ACP, as well as its relevance to care. For some, ACP had little to do with patient autonomy and served numerous other ethical, practical and political functions. Conclusion: The ethical assumptions regarding patient autonomy embedded in academic literature and policy documents relating to ACP are disconnected from the realities of clinical care. Medical norms and professional boundaries surrounding ‘good deaths’ have a greater influence on care than patient preference. ACP programs, therefore, may be rejected by healthcare professionals as irrelevant to care or may have the unintended consequence of limiting patient autonomy when used as a professional tool to encourage a ‘right’ way to die. A singular focus on bureaucratic ACP programs, which reduce patient autonomy to a ‘tick box’ exercise, may fail to enhance EOL care in any meaningful way.",10.1007/s00520-017-3867-5,1135258,Stephanie Johnson,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Medical School,Central Clinical School: Medicine,Health Sciences,Health services and systems,420000,420300,0.819,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.733,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Other biomedical and clinical sciences,320000.0,329900.0,0.656,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

Despite this, little is known about how multi-disciplinary teams work together in the face of differing views. Method: Constructionist thematic analysis was used to analyse data from semi-structured interviews conducted with 20 mental health clinicians based at three acute child and adolescent mental health care units. Case discussions in team meetings were also observed. Results: Views regarding diagnosis were largely a function of the role of team members and stratified according to hands-on involvement with young people. Nurses saw it as the least relevant to their practice, clinical psychologists and other allied health professionals were the most critical, and psychiatrists were the most pragmatic about the benefits. Despite these differences, and with a few exceptions, team unity was possible through dialogue regarding formulation.

Method: Following the European QI protocol, auditing and data extraction of medical records of consenting residents with dementia were conducted by trained auditors with relevant health care backgrounds. Detailed field notes by the auditors were also obtained to describe the characteristics of the participating care facilities, as well as key issues and challenges encountered, for each of the 12 QIs. Results: Sixteen residential care facilities in the seven Asia-Pacific sites participated in this study. Data from 275 residents’ records revealed each of the 12 Qis’ endorsement varied widely within and between the study sites (0%–100%). Quality of the medical records, family and cultural differences, definitions and scoring of certain indicators, and time-consuming nature of the QI administration were main concerns for implementation. Conclusion: Several items in the European QIs in the current format were deemed problematic when used to measure the quality of psychosocial care in the residential aged care settings in participating Asia-Pacific countries.

Main outcome measures Number of patients enquiring about medicinal cannabis, perceived knowledge of GPs, conditions where GPs perceived it to be beneficial, willingness to prescribe, preferred models of access, perceived adverse effects and safety relative to other prescription drugs. Results The majority of GPs (61.5%) reported one or more patient enquiries about medicinal cannabis in the last three months. Most felt that their own knowledge was inadequate and only 28.8% felt comfortable discussing medicinal cannabis with patients. Over half (56.5%) supported availability on prescription, with the preferred access model involving trained GPs prescribing independently of specialists. Support for use of medicinal cannabis was condition-specific, with strong support for use in cancer pain, palliative care and epilepsy, and much lower support for use in depression and anxiety.

Yet there remains confusion and ambiguity around how exposure in 'exposure therapy' is characterised. Current definitions are found to be inadequate, as each identifies certain features of the exposure process but omits others. As such, an elaborated model of exposure is presented, referred to here as the re-exposure-extinction learning process. This process involves a complex causal situation consisting of clinical features (the cause/causes, C), acting upon a person (the field, F), to bring about re-exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli and then extinction learning, leading, over time, to therapeutic change (the effect/effects, E). Importantly, re-exposure and extinction learning are two processes distinct from the therapeutic procedures (i.e., techniques and methods) used to bring them about. Furthermore, these processes are not inherently tied to a particular model of therapy or clinical intervention. They are, therefore, logically independent of the procedures used to facilitate them. Considering this reconceptualisation, we propose that working in the transference, a cornerstone of psychodynamic psychotherapy, can be understood as a complementary and effective method of facilitating the re-exposure-extinction learning process. We argue that this is achieved through enabling a person to repeatedly re-evaluate their fearful expectations as they manifest in the unfolding dynamics of the therapeutic relationship.

Personality detection is an intricate task that typically requires humans to fill out lengthy questionnaires assessing specific personality traits. The outcomes of this, however, may be unreliable or biased if the respondents do not fully understand or are not willing to honestly answer the questions. To this end, we propose a framework for objective personality detection that leverages humans’ physiological responses to external stimuli. We exemplify and evaluate the framework in a case study, where we expose subjects to affective image and video stimuli, and capture their physiological responses using a commercial-grade eye-tracking sensor.

Methods: Electronic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were conducted in May 2018. Peer-reviewed studies discussing the decision-making process in AYAs and/or their families were eligible for inclusion. Findings were analyzed thematically using Framework analysis. Results: Seven thousand two hundred seventy-three studies were screened, and 14 eligible studies were included. The synthesized themes aligned with the Supported Health Literacy Pathway model3 in that AYAs draw on their family members' knowledge, skills, and practices to generate informed options and make shared decisions.

Main outcome measures Demographic characteristics: sex, GP age groups (ie, <45, 45-54, 55+ years), GP country of training, patient age grouping (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-18 years), postcode, concession card status, indigenous status, up to three patient encounter reasons, up to four encounter problems/diagnoses and the clinical management actioned by the GP. Results Children's foot, ankle or leg problems were managed at a rate of 2.05 (95% CI 1.99 to 2.11) per 100 encounters during 229 137 GP encounters with children. There was a significant increase in the rate of foot, ankle and leg problems managed per 100 children in the population, from 6.1 (95% CI 5.3 to 6.8) in 2005-2006 to 9.0 (95% CI 7.9 to 10.1) in 2015-2016. Management of children's foot, ankle and leg problems were independently associated with male patients (30% more than female), older children (15-18 years were 7.1 times more than <1 years), male GPs (13% more) and younger GPs (<45 years of age 13% more than 55+). The top four most frequently managed problems were injuries (755.9 per 100 000 encounters), infections (458.2), dermatological conditions (299.4) and unspecified pain (176.3). The most frequently managed problems differed according to age grouping. Conclusions Children commonly present to GPs for foot, ankle and leg problems. Presentation frequencies varied according to age. Unexpectedly, conditions presenting commonly in adults, but rarely in children, were also frequently recorded. This data highlights the importance of initiatives supporting contemporary primary care knowledge of diagnoses and management of paediatric lower limb problems to minimise childhood burden of disease.",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062063,1024070,Julie Gordon,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,NCCH,Health Sciences,Health services and systems,420000,420300,0.944,Health Sciences,Public health,420000.0,420600.0,0.868,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Paediatrics,320000.0,321300.0,0.826,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses content analysis to compare and contrast the newspaper discourse surrounding the OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in four countries with above OECD average performance: Japan and South Korea (improving performance) and Australia and Finland (declining performance). PISA has attracted much government and public attention because it reflects education and the economic value of that education. Findings: There are key contrasts in the discourses of the four countries. Despite shifts to globalised perspectives on education, strong national and cultural differences remain. Educational competitiveness and economic competitiveness are strong discourses in Japan and South Korea, while in Australia and Finland, the focus is on educational competitiveness. The media in Finland has few references to economic competitiveness and it does not feature in Australia. The discourse themes on PISA from 2001 to 2015 are presented with trends in educational attainment and shifting national perspectives on education. Research limitations/implications: Analysis is limited to the top two circulation newspapers in English language in each country over 2001 to 2015. These newspapers in Finland, Japan and South Korea include translated content from local language papers. Originality/value: The paper provides longitudinal perspectives to understand the contrasting societal values placed on education and how these relate to perspectives on competitiveness. This media evidence on national discourses can inform education policy orientations in the four countries examined.",10.1108/JABS-08-2016-0108,1144748,Edward Davis,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Education and Social Work,Education,Education,Specialist studies in education,390000,390400,0.592,Education,"Education policy, sociology and philosophy",390000.0,390200.0,0.525,Education,Education systems,390000.0,390300.0,0.443,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True

A second aim is to identify approaches to knowing in schools (defined as curriculum) that might help us to identify possibilities for improvement in Indigenous student engagement and achievement in Australian schools. Given that education is representational practice, this SLR explores various representations of the world and how these might be taught in schools in ways that support “successful learning” for Indigenous students. We focus on how the curriculum might allow for multiple stories to be told, and how it can support the multiplicity of social and cultural identities. The question for this segment of the SLR is, how does curriculum govern learning for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in Australia?

This study explored how hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) protects grain yield formation in wheat crops exposed to heat during different developmental phases. Two wheat genotypes, Ujala-16 and Anaj-17, of varying heat tolerances, were subjected to heat stress (32 °C/20 °C) at pre-anthesis, anthesis, and post-anthesis stages under glasshouse and field conditions. Before heat stress treatment, the plants were sprayed with 60-ppm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Post-stress changes in leaf physiology were studied to understand the heat recovery mechanism. Despite significant genotypic variations, high temperature damaged leaf physiology and grain yield of both studied wheat genotypes. On average, high temperatures during any developmental phase caused more damage to Anaj-17 than to Ujala-16. Compared with the control, the plants heated during pre-anthesis, anthesis, and post-anthesis produced 44%, 35%, and 25% lesser grains yield per spike (averaged across genotypes and experiments), respectively. In contrast, post-anthesis-stressed plants produced the smallest grains compared to those heated during pre-anthesis or at anthesis. Compared with the control, H2O2-treated plants sustained significantly higher leaf chlorophyll and net photosynthetic rate by protecting cellular membranes from heat injury. Under hot conditions, hydrogen peroxide-treated plants yielded 17% more grains (averaged across the developmental phases and genotypes) than control plants. Our study suggests wheat performance can be improved through exogenous H2O2 application, particularly during terminal heat stress.",10.1007/s00344-022-10882-0,1128761,Ali Khoddami,Faculty of Science,School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),Biological Sciences,Plant biology,310000,310800,0.979,"Agricultural, Veterinary And Food Sciences",Crop and pasture production,300000.0,300400.0,0.771,Chemical Sciences,Physical chemistry,340000.0,340600.0,0.687,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True

Wildfire effects runoff, erosion, and increases the influx of other pollutants into catchment waterways. Research suggests that suspended sediment and nutrient levels increase following wildfire. However, past studies on catchment water quality change have generally focused on the short term (1-3 years) effects of wildfire. For appropriate catchment management, it is important to know the long-term effect of wildfire on catchment water quality and the recovery process. In this study, a statistical analysis was performed to examine the effect of 2001/2002 Sydney wildfire on catchment water quality. This research is particularly important, since the catchments studied provide drinking water to Sydney. Linear mixed models were used in this study in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)-type change detection approach to assess the effect of wildfire. We used both burnt and unburnt catchments to aid the interpretation of the results and to help disentangle the effects of natural climate variation, as well as of the wildfire. The results of this study showed persistent long-term (10-year) effects of wildfire, including increases in total suspended sediment concentrations (64% higher than in unburnt catchments), total nitrogen concentrations (48% higher), and total phosphorus (40% higher).",10.3390/w11030533,1145653,Mengran Yu,Faculty of Science,School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),Environmental Sciences,Environmental management,410000,410400,0.869,Earth Sciences,Physical geography and environmental geoscience,370000.0,370900.0,0.83,Earth Sciences,Hydrology,370000.0,370700.0,0.813,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

However, at a local scale, rich heterogeneity in seagrass ecosystems may lead to variability in carbon sequestration. Differences in carbon sequestration rates, both within and between seagrass meadows, are related to a wide range of interrelated biophysical and environmental variables that are difficult to measure holistically using traditional field surveys. Improved methods for producing robust, spatially explicit estimates of seagrass carbon storage across large areas would be highly valuable, but must capture complex biophysical heterogeneity and variability to be accurate and useful. Here, we review the current and emerging literature on biophysical processes which shape carbon storage in seagrass beds, alongside studies that map seagrass characteristics using satellite remote sensing data, to create a blueprint for the development of remote sensing-enabled proxies for seagrass carbon stock and sequestration. Applications of satellite remote sensing included measuring seagrass meadow extent, estimating above-ground biomass, mapping species composition, quantifying patchiness and patch connectivity, determining broader landscape environmental contexts, and characterising seagrass life cycles. All of these characteristics may contribute to variability in seagrass carbon storage. As such, remote sensing methods are uniquely placed to enable proxy-based estimates of seagrass carbon stock by capturing their biophysical characteristics, in addition to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and variability of these characteristics. Though the outlined approach is complex, it is suitable for accurately and efficiently producing a full picture of seagrass carbon stock. This review has drawn links between the processes of seagrass carbon sequestration and the capabilities of remote sensing to detect and characterise these processes. These links will facilitate the development of remote sensing-enabled proxies and support spatially explicit estimates of carbon stock, ensuring climate change mitigation and adaptation projects involving seagrass are accounted for with increased accuracy and reliability.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14153572,T24937,James Simpson,Faculty of Science,School of Geosciences,Geosciences,Earth Sciences,Oceanography,370000,370800,0.937,Earth Sciences,Geochemistry,370000.0,370300.0,0.781,Earth Sciences,Physical geography and environmental geoscience,370000.0,370900.0,0.704,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False

Certain canyons have been described as foraging ‘hotspots’ attributable to the high abundance of apex cetacean species aggregating in these areas. Anecdotal evidence of large seasonal aggregations of killer whales in the Bremer Canyon, south-west Australia, has attracted significant research attention in the last decade. To identify important environmental drivers influencing aggregation patterns, a predictive spatial habitat model using the Maxent model was developed based on presence-only whale sighting data. In addition, remotely sensed sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations were assessed to investigate the spatio-temporal variation in sea surface conditions. Habitat preference was predicted in areas between canyon heads, with the most influential predictor variables being depth and distance from the continental shelf break. Analysis of remote-sensing data highlighted low localised variability in surface waters and illustrated the seasonal trends of the Leeuwin Current. This study demonstrates the influence of bathymetry and submarine geomorphology on enhanced cetacean abundance and highlights the need for recognition of this potential foraging area in marine reserve planning.",10.1080/00049182.2019.1602901,1153356,Alexandra Jones,Faculty of Science,School of Geosciences,Geosciences,Biological Sciences,Zoology,310000,310900,0.96,Earth Sciences,Oceanography,370000.0,370800.0,0.906,Biological Sciences,Ecology,310000.0,310300.0,0.787,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True

These communities are increasingly vulnerable to climate (e.g. increasing cyclone occurrence and intensity) and environmental (e.g. mining and deforestation) stressors. Within these landscape systems, accurate and timely monitoring of human-climate-environment interactions is important to inform landscape management, land use policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Data collection and monitoring approaches exist to capture landscape-livelihood information such as surveys, participatory GIS (PGIS), and remote sensing. However, these monitoring approaches are challenged by data collection and management burdens, timely integration of databases and data streams, aligning system requirements with local needs, and socio-technical issues associated with low-resource development contexts. Such monitoring approaches only provide static representation of livelihood-landscape interactions failing to capture the dynamic nature of vulnerabilities, and benefit only a small user base. We present a prototype of a mobile, open-source geospatial tool being collaboratively developed with the Ministries of Agriculture in Fiji and Tonga and local stakeholders, to address the above shortcomings of PGIS and other environmental monitoring and data sharing approaches. The tool is being developed using open-source mobile GIS technologies following a formal ICT for Development (ICT4D) framework. We discuss the results for each component of the ICT4D framework which involves multiple landscape stakeholders across the two Small Island Developing States. Based on the ICT4D user requirements analysis, we produced a prototype open-source mobile geospatial data collection, analysis and sharing tool.

The SHE is a good example of a microtidal estuary, with irregular shorelines and a complex bathymetry, characterized by many headlands and islands forming a meandering main channel. Horizontal sediment transport showed a local estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) as a result of complex topography, independent of salinity fields and river flows during dry weather. The along-estuary advection of sediment was mainly driven by the mean advection, with a minor contribution by tidal pumping. Mean advection associated with barotropic forcing drives sediment flux seaward in the upper estuary and landward in the middle estuary, leading to a longitudinal convergence of sediment transport, without upstream or downstream migration of ETM during high river flows. The interactions between tidal currents, complex topography and asymmetric vertical mixing led to spring-neap and flood-ebb variations in sediment distribution. The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) method was used to calculate the relative contributions of the identified environmental forcing frequencies (tidal range, tidal frequency, river discharges, wind stress) to the variability in suspended-sediment concentration. Tidal frequency and river discharges were the major contributors to this variability. Tidal range made the highest contribution in the middle estuary, where the ETM was located, driving the spring-neap cycle of the ETM.",10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106605,1104822,Daniel Harrison,Faculty of Science,School of Geosciences,Geosciences,Earth Sciences,Oceanography,370000,370800,0.961,Earth Sciences,Geology,370000.0,370500.0,0.922,Earth Sciences,Hydrology,370000.0,370700.0,0.878,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True

Here, we used radium isotopes to quantify SGD-derived fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into Sydney Harbour estuary, Australia. Sydney is the most populated city of Oceania, with several localised cases of historical groundwater pollution. We sampled top and bottom waters at the harbour scale (~20 km) and also at four small scale embayments (~2 km). A decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations from upstream to downstream was observed. Mass balances constructed with 224Ra, 223Ra, and 226Ra revealed that total SGD ranged from 42 to 121 × 104 m3 d?1 depending on assumptions and isotope. These fluxes were related mostly to saline SGD (recirculated seawater), and are equivalent to >60 times the mean annual freshwater river discharge into Sydney Harbour (0.68 × 104 m3 d?1). The estimated SGD rates (2.2 ± 1.5 cm d?1) were comparable to the global average radium-derived-SGD in other urban estuaries (~3.1 cm d?1). No obvious relationships were observed between SGD and scale in Sydney Harbour. However, higher SGD rates estimated for embayments closer to the ocean indicate that a combination of waves, tides and urbanization control SGD. SGD derived fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for DOC, 6 for PO4 3?, 40 for NH4 + and 1.3 for NOX. Previous work has suggested that nutrients enter Sydney Harbour primarily through rivers or stormwater following episodic rain events.

Our understanding of its modern functioning is underpinned by direct observations, but its variability through time has been poorly quantified. Here we reconstruct oceanic plate carbon reservoirs and track the fate of subducted carbon using thermodynamic modelling. In the Mesozoic era, 250 to 66 million years ago, plate tectonic processes had a pivotal role in driving climate change. Triassic–Jurassic period cooling correlates with a reduction in solid Earth outgassing, whereas Cretaceous period greenhouse conditions can be linked to a doubling in outgassing, driven by high-speed plate tectonics. The associated ‘carbon subduction superflux’ into the subcontinental mantle may have sparked North American diamond formation. In the Cenozoic era, continental collisions slowed seafloor spreading, reducing tectonically driven outgassing, while deep-sea carbonate sediments emerged as the Earth’s largest carbon sink. Subduction and devolatilization of this reservoir beneath volcanic arcs led to a Cenozoic increase in carbon outgassing, surpassing mid-ocean ridges as the dominant source of carbon emissions 20 million years ago. An increase in solid Earth carbon emissions during Cenozoic cooling requires an increase in continental silicate weathering flux to draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide, challenging previous views and providing boundary conditions for future carbon cycle models.",10.1038/s41586-022-04420-x,1002492,Dietmar Muller,Faculty of Science,School of Geosciences,Geosciences,Earth Sciences,Geology,370000,370500,0.99,Earth Sciences,Geophysics,370000.0,370600.0,0.94,Earth Sciences,Physical geography and environmental geoscience,370000.0,370900.0,0.86,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True

Large-scale models play a key role in determining long range flow pathways from continental interiors to the oceans, yet struggle to simulate the local flow patterns offered by small-scale models. We have developed a highly scalable numerical framework to model continental groundwater flow which capture the intricate flow pathways between deep aquifers and the near-surface. The coupled thermal-hydraulic basin structure is inferred from hydraulic head measurements, recharge estimates from geochemical proxies, and borehole temperature data using a Bayesian framework. We use it to model the deep groundwater flow beneath the Sydney–Gunnedah–Bowen Basin, part of Australia’s largest aquifer system. Coastal aquifers have flow rates of up to 0.3 m/day, and a corresponding groundwater residence time of just 2,000 years. In contrast, our model predicts slow flow rates of 0.005 m/day for inland aquifers, resulting in a groundwater residence time of ? 400,000 years. Perturbing the model to account for a drop in borehole water levels since 2000, we find that lengthened inland flow pathways depart significantly from pre-2000 streamlines as groundwater is drawn further from recharge zones in a drying climate. Our results illustrate that progressively increasing water extraction from inland aquifers may permanently alter long-range flow pathways.

This study aimed to ascertain biobank research users' needs and opinions about biobanking services. Methods: An online survey was developed, which requested information about researcher demographics, localities of biobanks accessed, methods of sourcing biospecimens, and opinions on topics including but not limited to, application processes, data availability, access fees, and return of research results. There were 27 multiple choice/check box questions, 4 questions with a 10-point Likert scale, and 8 questions with provision for further comment. A web link for the survey was distributed to researchers in late 2019/early 2020 in four Australian states: New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia. Results: Respondents were generally satisfied with biobank application processes and the fit for purpose of received biospecimens/data. Nonetheless, most researchers (n = 61/99, 62%) reported creating their own collections owing to gaps in sample availability and a perceived increase in efficiency. Most accessed biobanks (n = 58/74, 78%) were in close proximity (local or intrastate) to the researcher.

Risk communication is one of crucial element to manage food safety. While current food safety studies have focused on contamination of hazards or risk factors, limited research exists on consumer concerns, knowledge and perception about the actual risk food poses to their health. This study aimed to assess and compare the knowledge and perceptions regarding food safety, and the information needed and trusted by pork consumers in Northern Vietnam. Methods: A total of 225 consumers recruited from three different market types: modern urban, traditional urban and traditional rural, were interviewed using a questionnaire between November to December 2019. Results: The majority of participants (81.8%) were female and consumers interviewed at modern urban retail were younger than those interviewed at traditional retail settings (p < 0.01). Sixty-five percent of participants across the three retail types agreed that microbes were the most common hazards which can make them sick, but the adverse health effect due to chemical hazards was ranked higher than that of biological hazards. Most participants often received food safety information that was about animal diseases (such as African swine fever most recently), chemical contamination and the unknown origin of food rather than about food poisoning and measures to prevent it. Food safety messages from television and professional experts were the most trusted sources and consumer preference was for information about the origin of food (traceability) and how to choose safe food. Participants were willing to receive food safety information daily to weekly. A lack of perception and awareness about animal welfare related to pig farming or slaughtering was reported by most respondents (84.3%).

And if so, are there pathways to sustainable credit and finance in the face of the perceived excesses of financialization? Can we reform or regulate the financial sector to promote sustainable credit and avoid over-indebtedness? These and similar questions have attracted considerable scholarly and public debate in the aftermath of the 2007 global financial crisis, with a growing focus on institutional alternatives to market exchange in finance and beyond. In this article, we study the persistence of non-intermediated credit, whereby lenders and borrowers engage in transactions directly and without financial intermediaries. Peer lending was a mainstay source of credit prior to the emergence of financial intermediaries and our benchmark case study outlines common features of credit relationships before modern banking in Europe. The other two case studies come from jurisdictions where non-intermediated credit persists on a broad scale, despite parties having formal access to modern finance. The aim of our contribution is threefold. First, we identify features of non-intermediated transactions that are consistent with a notion of sustainable credit, in the sense that they are not destabilising for the transacting parties (or the broader community). Secondly, we highlight the normative mechanisms that support non-intermediated credit across different settings to identify the scope conditions and limits for such transactions. Third, we evaluate such credit transactions along a set of normative benchmarks to draw out lessons for contemporary finance and financial regulation. We argue that even if non-intermediated credit cannot provide an alternative to modern finance, such transactions can help financial institutions tailor products to the needs of specific consumers or outsource credit assessment and repayment, while also allowing policymakers and regulators to identify and resolve concrete credit access problems for disadvantaged communities.",10.1007/s10603-022-09529-0,1005659,Yane Svetiev,Sydney Law School,Sydney Law School,Law,Economics,Economic theory,380000,380300,0.749,Economics,Applied economics,380000.0,380100.0,0.642,,,,,,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True

This article describes two measures that can quantify sampling fairness and geochemical consensus. Concretely, sampling fairness considers spatial factors such as sampling density and bias in the spatial distribution of blastholes whereas geochemical consensus considers the agreement between the assay samples within a grade-block. Geochemical disparity is measured using a robust distance estimator and a masking formula that takes into account the proportion of outliers and magnitude of differences observed above a threshold. The efficacy of the consensus measure is demonstrated through validation experiments. The results confirm the MCD (minimum covariance determinant) robust estimator can breakdown when the fraction of outliers exceeds (n?k?1)/(2n). For k?2 variables and a sample size n?10, this typically leads to an underestimation of the true extent and impact of outliers when they exceed 40%. An extension based on split-sequence analysis is proposed to overcome this limitation. The method is evaluated using production data from an open-pit iron ore deposit.

Calculating geophysics from naively voxelized geology, as exported from commonly used geological modeling tools, can produce a poor approximation to the true likelihood, degrading posterior inference for structural parameters. We develop a simple integrated Bayesian inversion code, called Blockworlds, showcasing a numerical scheme to calculate anti-aliased rock properties over regular meshes for use with gravity and magnetic sensors.

To test this research question, we used a suite of field and laboratory methods including GPS collars, wool cortisol, and epigenetic change between ewes and lambs identified using Illumina NovaSeq RRBS. Once shorn ewes (n = 24) were kept on their full fleece throughout the entire gestation period, whereas twice (early) shorn ewes (n = 24) had their wool shorn pre-joining. Top-knot wool sample was taken from ewes during pre-joining, day 50 (mid-gestation), and day 90 (late gestation) for laboratory analysis. Ewes were pregnancy scanned at mid-gestation to determine whether they were early or late parturition (this confirmation is provided by the pregnancy scanner based on fetus size). Top-knot wool sample was also taken from the lambs at weaning for hormone and wool quality testing. Ear tissue was taken from ewes at day 50 (mid-gestation) and from lambs at lamb marking for DNA analysis. Results showed that twice or early shorn ewes grazed 10% higher and maintained stronger body condition than once shorn ewes. Wool cortisol levels were also significantly lower in the early shorn ewes between mid- and late gestation. Lambs bred from twice shorn ewes had on average better visual wool quality parameters in terms of micron, spin finesses, and curvature. For the DNA methylation results, when comparing a group of once sheared with twice sheared ewes, we have discovered one locus (Chr20:50404014) that was significantly differentially methylated [False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0.005]. This locus is upstream of a protein-coding gene (ENSOARG00000002778.1), which shows similarities to the forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) mRNA using BLAST searches. To further our understanding of the potential interaction between pregnancy status and shearing frequency of the ewes, we performed further differential methylation analysis using a combination of shearing treatment and pregnancy scanning status. The comparisons (1) late pregnancy vs. early pregnancy for ewes with one shearing treatment and (2) late pregnancy vs. early pregnancy for sheep with two shearing treatments were carried out to identify associations between loci and pregnancy duration for sheep with either one or two shearing events. We discovered that 36 gene loci were significantly modulated either between different shearing treatments or late vs. early pregnancy status of ewes. This result suggests that maternal pregnancy and nutritional status during gestation influence DNA methylation. We further investigated DNA methylation in lambs and identified 16 annotated gene loci that showed epigenetic modulation as a result of being born from an early or late stage pregnancy. From the genomics data, we pointed out that ewes go through epigenetic modifications during gestation, and there is a degree of intra-individual variation in the reproductive performance of ewes, which could be due to combination of intrinsic (genetic and physiological) and extrinsic (management and climatic) factors. Collectively, this research provides novel dataset combining physiological, molecular epigenetics, and digital tracking indices that advances our understanding of how Merino ewes respond to shearing frequency, and this information could guide further research on Merino sheep breeding and welfare.",10.3389/fvets.2022.830450,1171814,Gregory Sawyer,Faculty of Science,School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),Biological Sciences,Zoology,310000,310900,0.977,Biological Sciences,Genetics,310000.0,310500.0,0.817,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

This paper investigates population change of the non-Han ethnic minorities (NHEMs) over the past six decades. The number of NHEMs as a whole tripled from 1953 to 2010. However, growth has differed among individual groups and in different time periods. The population of some groups has fluctuated while that of others has grown steadily, regardless of the size of the groups. As a whole, since 2000 the growth rate of NHEMs has been lower than that of the Han Chinese, and the population of 13 NHEM groups has begun to decline. A growing number of people belonging to ethnic minorities have switched their ethnic identities to Han. This has especially been the case for NHEM youth. The change in ethnic minority populations has been influenced by dynamic interactions among demographic factors, ethnic identification as well as political, economic and policy changes.",10.1080/17441730.2019.1594657,1139010,Catherine Ingram,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,Musicology Unit,"History, Heritage And Archaeology",Historical studies,430000,430300,0.684,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Water governance must grapple with these ‘systemic’ climate risks and prepare communities for the wideranging and significant changes that will occur. But addressing climate risks will require governments and water regulators to move beyond existing practices and take into account non-stationarity as well as stochastic and non-linear changes in the future climate. Governance systems will need to be structured to engage more directly and intensively with the many perspectives on how much water can be consumed now and in the future. This article evaluates the legal content of the governance regime for climate risks in the MDB, drawing conclusions on who, or what, bears the risk of climate change. It will then use theories of risk governance and deliberative democracy to demonstrate how the systematic adoption of a deliberative approach through statutory evaluation and review processes could improve the MDB regime’s problem-solving capabilities, as well as its ability to reduce polarisation in a hotter, drier climate",10.36633/ulr.826,1119204,Katherine Owens,Sydney Law School,Sydney Law School,Law,Earth Sciences,Physical geography and environmental geoscience,370000,370900,0.703,Environmental Sciences,Environmental management,410000.0,410400.0,0.702,Earth Sciences,Climate change science,370000.0,370200.0,0.652,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Water rights and water relationality can be constructed as opposite ends of a spectrum of legal modalities for defining and regulating the human/water relationship. However, when considered through the lens of law, rights and relationality can also be seen as intertwined. The legal instruments that create individual rights to take and use water situate those rights within frameworks that regulate the relationship between humans (both collectively and individually) and between humans and the water ecosystem. We begin with an identification and exploration of three water rights discourses in legal scholarship: water as a private right (to take and use), the human right to water, and the rights of rivers. We then consider emerging legal scholarship on the more complex reality of water relationality, focusing on the role of law in water commoning, Indigenous laws, and environmental restorative justice. In doing so, we identify points of intersection between these discourses as mediated through law. We also identify critiques of both water rights and water relationality discourses in law and the ways in which they shape our ability to respond to water crises.",,1185567,Rachel Killean,Sydney Law School,Sydney Law School,Law,Law And Legal Studies,Law in context,480000,480400,0.694,Law And Legal Studies,Legal systems,480000.0,480500.0,0.673,Law And Legal Studies,Environmental and resources law,480000.0,480200.0,0.607,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

Current validated prognostic factors (e.g., histological grade, lymph node involvement, receptor status, and proliferation index), as well as multigene tests (e.g., Oncotype DX and PAM50) are helpful to describe breast cancer characteristics and predict the chance of recurrence risk and survival. Nevertheless, they are invasive and cannot capture a complete heterogeneity of the entire breast tumor resulting in up to 30% of patients being either over- or under-treated for breast cancer. Furthermore, multigene testings are time consuming and expensive. Radiomics is emerging as a reliable, accurate, non-invasive, and cost-effective approach of using quantitative image features to classify breast cancer characteristics and predict patient outcomes. Several recent radiomics reviews have been conducted in breast cancer, however, specific mammography-based radiomics studies have not been well discussed. This scoping review aims to assess and summarize the current evidence on the potential usefulness of mammography-based (i.e., digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, and contrast-enhanced mammography) radiomics in predicting factors that describe breast cancer characteristics, recurrence, and survival. Materials and Methods: PubMed database and eligible text reference were searched using relevant keywords to identify studies published between 2015 and December 19, 2020. Studies collected were screened and assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Eighteen eligible studies were included and organized into three main sections: radiomics predicting breast cancer characteristics, radiomics predicting breast cancer recurrence and survival, and radiomics integrating with clinical data. Majority of publications reported retrospective studies while three studies examined prospective cohorts. Encouraging results were reported, suggesting the potential clinical value of mammography-based radiomics. Further efforts are required to standardize radiomics approaches and catalogue reproducible and relevant mammographic radiomic features. The role of integrating radiomics with other information is discussed. Conclusion: The potential role of mammography-based radiomics appears promising but more efforts are required to further evaluate its reliability as a routine clinical tool.",10.1016/j.acra.2021.09.025,ssiv6387,Somphone Siviengphanom,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Medical School,Medicine Faculty Office,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Oncology and carcinogenesis,320000,321100,0.648,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Other biomedical and clinical sciences,320000.0,329900.0,0.549,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Clinical sciences,320000.0,320200.0,0.479,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

We conducted a survey of five neonicotinoids in soil, water and sediment samples along gradients from crops fields to protected lowland tropical forest, mangroves and wetlands in northern Belize, a region of high biodiversity value. Neonicotinoid frequency of detection and concentrations were highest in soil (68%) and lowest in water (12%). Imidacloprid was the most common residue reaching a maximum of 17.1 ng/g in soil samples. Concentrations in soils differed among crop types, being highest in melon fields and lowest in banana and sugarcane fields. Residues in soil declined with distance to the planted fields, with clothianidin being detected at 100 m and imidacloprid at more than 10 km from the nearest applied field. About half (47%) of the sediments collected contained residues of at least one compound up to 10 km from the source. Total neonicotinoid concentrations in sediments (range 0.014–0.348 ng/g d. w.) were about 10 times lower than in soils from the fields, with imidacloprid being the highest (0.175 ng/g). A probabilistic risk assessment of the residues in the aquatic environment indicates that 31% of sediment samples pose a risk to invertebrate aquatic and benthic organisms by chronic exposure, whereas less than 5% of sediment samples may incur a risk by acute exposure. Current residue levels in water samples do not appear to pose risks to the aquatic fauna. Fugacity modeling of the four main compounds detected suggest that most of the dissipation from the agricultural fields occurs via runoff and leaching through the porous soils of this region. We call for better monitoring of pesticide contamination and invertebrate inventories and finding alternatives to the use of neonicotinoids in agriculture. Neonicotinoid residues found in wetlands of a Neotropical Nature Reserve pose a risk to aquatic invertebrates.",10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.099,1003080,Francisco Sanchez-Bayo,Faculty of Science,School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),School of Life and Environmental Sciences (SOLES),Environmental Sciences,Environmental management,410000,410400,0.821,Environmental Sciences,Pollution and contamination,410000.0,410500.0,0.65,Earth Sciences,Geochemistry,370000.0,370300.0,0.597,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,True

Various opposition movements embrace philosophy but reject realism, either completely or partially, despite upholding ideas consistent with a realist philosophy. Many on both sides see the Tower of Babel that constitutes psychology as a sign of healthy diversity, not fragmentation. We argue that relations among the three factors–philosophy, realism and fragmentation–deserve closer scrutiny. With philosophy’s core method of conceptual analysis deprioritized, both mainstream psychology and the opposition fracture into an array of “partial realisms”, falling away from a realism that is thoroughly consistent. These are the source of psychology’s fragmentation. The conceptual neglect and resulting confusions can be seen in psychology’s recent replicability crisis, and in the widespread adoption of a representationalist approach to the mind/brain. We argue that the metatheoretical coherence and methodological maturity required for genuine scientific progress involves a consistent adherence to realism.

In New Zealand (NZ), M?ori (indigenous New Zealanders) and Pacific people experience higher rates of AF compared with non-M?ori/non-Pacific people. Aim: To describe a primary care population with AF in NZ. Stroke risk and medication adherence according to ethnicity are also detailed. Methods: Electronic medical records for adults (?20 years, n = 135 840, including 19 918 M?ori and 43 634 Pacific people) enrolled at 37 NZ general practices were analysed for AF diagnosis and associated medication prescription information. Results: The overall prevalence of non-valvular AF (NVAF) in this population was 1.3% (1769), and increased with age (4.4% in people ?55 years). M?ori aged ?55 years were more likely to be diagnosed with NVAF (7.3%) than Pacific (4.0%) and non-M?ori/non-Pacific people (4.1%, P < 0.001). M?ori and Pacific NVAF patients were diagnosed with AF 10 years earlier than non-M?ori/non-Pacific patients (median age of diagnosis: M?ori = 60 years, Pacific = 61 years, non-M?ori/non-Pacific = 71 years, P < 0.001). Overall, 67% of NVAF patients were at high risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc ? 2) at the time of AF diagnosis. Almost half (48%) of M?ori and Pacific NVAF patients aged <65 years were at high risk for stroke, compared with 22% of non-M?ori/non-Pacific (P < 0.001). Irrespective of ethnic group, adherence to AF medication was suboptimal in those NVAF patients with a high risk of stroke or with stroke history. Conclusion: AF screening and stroke thromboprophylaxis in M?ori and Pacific people could start below the age of 65 years in NZ.",10.1111/imj.13648,1000829,Ben Freedman,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Medical Research Institutes,Heart Research Institute,Health Sciences,Epidemiology,420000,420200,0.954,Health Sciences,Public health,420000.0,420600.0,0.906,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Cardiovascular medicine and haematology,320000.0,320100.0,0.865,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,True

There was a high prevalence of unhealthy food consumption and unhealthy dietary patterns among a) a large proportion of the population, and b) across sociodemographic and health behaviour groups, with a higher prevalence of particular at-risk patterns in some specific groups including women of younger age and women of higher wealth.

Whilst archives hold knowledge systems that encode cultural practices of huge importance to current Australian Indigenous language revitalization projects, women have often been marginalized and excluded due to culturally inappropriate practices of collection, storage, and access. As women working in an archive, the authors provide a gendered perspective on the development of workflow processes that have the potential to re-orientate the relationship with endangered language communities and contribute to the negotiation of agency for Aboriginal women in the archival space. This paper draws on the experience of an Australian archiving service involved in a partnership with an Aboriginal organization to digitize resources and facilitate their return to the originating communities. As part of the partnership, tapes of women's songs from central Australia were digitized using the skills of a female audio engineer. The paper argues that utilizing a female chain of linguist, anthropologist, musicologist, data administrator, and audio engineer in a participatory loop empowered the women in community to make choices knowing that their cultural property was being handled with respect and in a culturally appropriate manner.",,1115039,Jodie Kell,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,Sydney Conservatorium of Music,PARADISEC,Information And Computing Sciences,Library and information studies,460000,461000,0.753,Information And Computing Sciences,Other information and computing sciences,460000.0,469900.0,0.594,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Its anonymous authors stress the value of life and introduce different modes of avoiding death. One is to prolong life by moral conduct and proper social organisation so that everyone can live as long as destined for him or her at birth. Another mode is to avoid death by «entering the thatched hut» for an intensive meditation practice that will transform someone’s physical condition and allow him or her to live on in this world or in a world beyond. A third mode relies on visualising spirits and is designed for an adept who has retired from worldly affairs, belongs to a religious community and hopes that instead of dying he will «rise to heaven in broad daylight » and become a celestial official. These three modes are not depicted as being in conflict but as stages in an ongoing process. The authors of the Scripture are the first to assemble these modes and assign the search for life and study of immortality a central role in propagating social order. For them, this study has much in common with self-cultivation. Someone in search of avoiding death is expected to venerate heaven, follow heavenderived rules of conduct and practice meditation. He is not seen as in need of special techniques and recipes.

Actions can only succeed when guided by “being of oneself” (ziran ??) in regard to one’s own person and simultaneously in regard to the things or people one acts on.

Design: A cross-sectional mediation analysis using a stratified and nationally representative cross-sectional health survey collected from 2016 to 2017 in New Zealand. Setting: New Zealand. Participants: We used data from 9884 participants who identified as New Zealand European (7341; 56.9% female) or M?ori (2543; 60.5% female) in the 2016–17 New Zealand Health Survey. Measurements: We included reports from demographic items (sex, age, ethnicity), the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and experiences of past year discrimination. We conducted mediation analysis with M?ori identification as the predictor, hazardous drinking as the binary outcome (0 = AUDIT score less than 8, 1 = 8+) and discrimination as the binary mediator (0 = no discrimination, 1 = experienced racial discrimination). Age, sex and deprivation index were included as covariates. Findings: M?ori were more likely to experience discrimination than New Zealand Europeans, and both M?ori identification and experiencing discrimination were associated with elevated levels of hazardous alcohol use, P < 0.05.

Proper incentive can play an important role in encouraging the private deployment of LoRa, increasing coverage and promoting effective management of IoT-IS. However, existing incentive mechanisms have the vulnerabilities of insecure centralized architecture and excessive utility loss of LoRa Controllers and Gateways, due to asymmetric information between private owners of gateways and centralized controller (or service providers). Blockchain-based LoRa networks, as a promising solution, have not been comprehensively studied to address the vulnerabilities, let alone the other issues of security, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Chained LoRa-based information system (LoRa-IS) to provide globally cross-validated security. Behaviors, including state-of-the-art contract-theoretic incentive mechanism and new flow control protocol, can be secured with the tamper-resistance of Blockchains. Being part of the proposed incentive mechanism, the new self-driven flow control allows both the Dual-Chain system and the LoRa network to scale. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed system is the first comprehensive Blockchain-based LoRa-IS combined with contract theory. We also provide analysis and simulations, showing that our system can pay fair incentives under information asymmetry.

On poultry farms, the accumulation of waste such as faeces, carcasses and unsellable eggs creates environmental and health hazards that need to be mitigated. The larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens; BSFL) offer a potential solution to the problems of waste management on poultry farms. BSFL consume large quantities of organic waste and convert it into larval biomass, which can then be processed for use as livestock feeds or biofuels. This makes BSFL an ideal candidate for value-added waste management on chicken farms. Here, we examined the development and nutrient profile of BSFL given five different diet treatments: poultry feed (control), chicken meat, chicken egg, chicken manure and a mixture of equal parts chicken meat, egg and manure. Chicken meat, egg and mixed diets were all found to be suitable feedstocks for BSFL, but the manure-only treatment was associated with a high failure rate of larval development. Mixing manure with other poultry waste streams ameliorated the negative impacts of manure on BSFL. Larvae reared on chicken meat, egg and the mixed diet had equal or higher mean crude protein (CP) (39.9%, 33.8% and 31.5%, respectively) and crude lipid (CL) contents (30.1%, 29.00% and 28.7%, respectively), compared with BSFL reared exclusively on chicken feed (CP: 30.9%, CL: 23.8%), demonstrating the suitability of these waste-stream diets for the potential animal feed quality of the BSFL.

It assesses the adoption of distance learning using various online application tools that have gained widespread attention during the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Distance learning thrives as a legitimate alternative to classroom instructions, as major cities around the globe are locked down amid the COVID-19 pandemic. To save the academic year, educational institutions have reacted to the situation impulsively and adopted distance learning platforms using online resources. This study surveyed random undergraduate students to identify the impact of trust in formal and informal information sources, awareness and the readiness to adopt distance learning. In this study, we have hypothesized that adopting distance learning is an outcome of situational awareness and readiness, which is achieved by the trust in the information sources related to distance learning. The findings indicate that trust in information sources such as institute and media information or interpersonal communication related to distance learning programs is correlated with awareness (? = 0.423, t = 12.296, p = 0.000) and contribute to readiness (? = 0.593, t = 28.762, p = 0.001). The structural model path coefficient indicates that readiness strongly influences the adoption of distance learning (? = 0.660, t = 12.798, p = 0.000) amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Our proposed model recorded a predictive relevance (Q2) of 0.377 for awareness, 0.559 for readiness, and 0.309 for the adoption of distance learning, which explains how well the model and its parameter estimates reconstruct the values.

This study focuses on the understudied adolescent population of New Caledonia with the aim to (1) determine the daily PA levels and estimate the sedentary time through out-of-school sitting time; (2) highlight the influence of sociodemographic and environmental factors, and (3) assess the associations of PA and sitting time with overweight and obesity. A sample of 508 school-going adolescents living in New Caledonia was surveyed about their PA habits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Short Form, as well as about the context in which they usually engage in PA. The influences of the place of living and ethnic community were also investigated. Results indicated that about 66% of the adolescents performed an average of at least 60 min of PA daily. Both Melanesian adolescent boys and girls were more active than Caucasian adolescents but only when they lived in rural areas (females: 115 vs. 93 min/day, p = 0.018; males: 133 vs. 97 min/day, p = 0.018). Indeed, PA was reduced in an urban environment (females: 88 min/day; males: 95 min/day, p = 0.028; rural vs. urban in Melanesian adolescents). Melanesian adolescents also spent less time in out-of-school sitting than Caucasian adolescents independently of where they lived (females: 164 vs. 295 min/day, p < 0.001; males: 167 vs. 239 min/day, p = 0.001). Feeling safe was positively associated with PA levels (females: ORadj = 2.85, p < 0.001; males: ORadj = 4.45, p < 0.001). In the adolescent boys, accessibility to a suitable place was also an important factor (ORadj = 2.94, p = 0.002). Finally, while PA and sitting time were negatively associated with overweight in male adolescents (ORadj = 0.28, p = 0.044 and ORadj = 0.39, p = 0.004), they were not in females. Living in a rural area allowed the Melanesian adolescents to maintain a more active lifestyle with more physical activities and less sitting time.

We Investigated the yield of cyclotron-produced 68Ga, extraction of [68Ga]GaCl3 and subsequent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 labeling using an automated synthesis module. Methods: Irradiations of a 1.0 M solution of [68Zn]Zn(NO3)2 in dilute (0.2–0.3 M) HNO3 were conducted using GE PETtrace cyclotrons and GE 68Ga liquid targets. The proton beam energy was degraded to a nominal 14.3 MeV to minimize the co-production of 67Ga through the 68Zn(p,2n)67Ga reaction without unduly compromising 68Ga yields. We also evaluated the effects of varying beam times (50–75 min) and beam currents (27–40 ?A). Crude 68Ga production was measured. The extraction of [68Ga]GaCl3 was performed using a 2 column solid phase method on the GE FASTlab Developer platform. Extracted [68Ga]GaCl3 was used to label [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 that was intended for clinical use. Results: The decay corrected yield of 68Ga at EOB was typically > 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) for a 60 min beam, with irradiations of [68Zn]Zn(NO3)2 at 0.3 M HNO3. Target/chemistry performance was more consistent when compared with 0.2 M HNO3. Radionuclidic purity of 68Ga was typically > 99.8% at EOB and met the requirements specified in the European Pharmacopoeia (< 2% combined 66/67Ga) for a practical clinical product shelf-life. The activity yield of [68Ga]GaCl3 was typically > 50% (~ 1.85 GBq, 50 mCi); yields improved as processes were optimized. Labeling yields for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 were near quantitative (~ 1.67 GBq, 45 mCi) at EOS. Cyclotron produced [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 underwent full quality control, stability and sterility testing, and was implemented for human use at the University of Michigan as an Investigational New Drug through the US FDA and also at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA).

The aim of this study was to support an advocacy coalition in the Solomon Islands with evidence-based consideration of the development and implementation of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), sensitive to local contextual factors and constraints. In 2017-19, we conducted a prospective policy analysis, including document analysis and qualitative interviews with key stakeholders to elicit policy-relevant data, a quantitative analysis to frame the policy problem and examine appropriate implementation mechanisms, and economic modelling to outline the potential benefits associated with different proposed policy solutions. Applying an action-oriented approach to prospective policy analysis enabled us as researchers to engage in the needs of a 'pro-SSB tax' advocacy coalition and prepare them to exploit policy opportunities created by the meeting of policy 'streams'. Our analysis demonstrated that SSBs were being consumed in relatively large amounts, especially by children, and that there were likely to be substantial health and economic benefits associated with a SSB tax. Increasing fiscal uncertainty for key sectors had created an environment prime for the advocacy coalition to pursue the adoption of an SSB tax. However, we found that policymakers face a number of practical challenges in securing effective adoption and implementation of global food policy recommendations, including that it is difficult to demonstrate the potential efficacy of interventions in the local context. The development of a policy package based on local factors resulted in a policy product that was likely to be more persuasive for local policymakers and policy leaders.

Despite its economic significance, very few studies have reported the genetic evaluation of economically important morphological size and shape traits of shrimp grown in commercial grow-out environments. In this study we obtained genetic parameter estimates and evaluated genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE) for nine body morphological traits of shrimp derived from images. The data set contained image and body weight (BW) records of 5,308 shrimp, from 64 sires and 54 dams, reared in eight grow-out ponds for an average of 133 days. From the images, landmark based morphological distances were computed from which novel morphological traits associated with size and shape were derived for genetic evaluation. These traits included body weight (BW), body length (BL), body size (BS), head size (HS), Abdominal size (AS), abdominal percentage (AP), tail tip (TT), front by back ratio (FBR), condition factor (CF) and condition factor length (CFL). We also evaluated G×E interaction effects of these traits for shrimp reared in different ponds. The heritability estimates for growth related morphological and body weight traits were moderately high (BW: h2 = 0.32 ± 0.05; BL: h2 = 0.36 ± 0.06; BS: h2 = 0.32 ± 0.05; HS: h2 = 0.31 ± 0.05; AS: h2 = 0.32 ± 0.05; and TT: h2 = 0.28 ± 0.05) and low for abdominal percentage and body shape traits (AP: h2 = 0.09 ± 0.02; FBR: h2 = 0.08 ± 0.02; CF: h2 = 0.06 ± 0.02; and CFL: h2 = 0.003 ± 0.004). G × E interaction were negligible for all traits for shrimp reared in different ponds, suggesting re-ranking is not prevalent for this population. Genetic correlations among growth related morphological traits were high ranging from 0.36 to 0.99, suggesting these traits can be simultaneously improved through indirect genetic selection. However, negative genetic correlations were observed for FBR & CF shape traits with major growth traits (ranged ?0.08 to ?0.95), suggesting genetic selection for rapid growth will likely result in thick/fatty shrimp over generations. Our study showed image-based landmark data can be successfully employed for genetic evaluation of complex morphological traits of shrimp and is potentially amenable to machine-learning derived parameters in semi-automated high volume phenotyping systems needed under commercial conditions.",10.3389/fgene.2022.1007123,1160435,MD Mehedi Hasan,Faculty of Science,School of Veterinary Science,Veterinary Science,Biological Sciences,Genetics,310000,310500,0.951,Biological Sciences,Zoology,310000.0,310900.0,0.869,Biological Sciences,Bioinformatics and computational biology,310000.0,310200.0,0.701,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

While the impact of strong magnetic fields on the overall response of ionization chambers has been simulated and measured before, this work investigates the local impact of the magnetic field on dose response in an ion chamber. High-resolution 1D and 2D response maps have been created for two small clinical thimble ionization chambers, the PinPoint chambers 31006 and 31014 (Physikalisch Technische Werkstaetten Freiburg, Germany). Methods: Working on the Imaging and Medical Beam Line of the Australian Synchrotron an intense kilovoltage radiation beam with very low divergence, collimated to 0.1 mm was used to scan the chambers by moving them on a 2D motion platform. Measured current and beam position were correlated to create the response maps. Small neodymium magnets were used to create a field of about 0.25 T. Chamber axis, magnetic field, and beam direction were perpendicular to each other. Measurements were performed with both orientations of the magnetic field as well as without it. Chamber biases of 5 and 250 V in both polarities were used. Results: The local distribution of the response of small thimble-type ionization chambers was found to be impacted by a magnetic field. Depending on the orientation of the magnetic field, the chamber response near the stem was either enhanced or reduced with the response near the tip behaving the opposite way. Local changes were in the order of up to 40% compared to measurements without the magnetic field present. Bending of the central electrode was observed for the chamber with the steel electrode. The size of the volume of reduced collection near the guard electrode was impacted by the magnetic field. As the here investigated beam and field parameters differ from those of clinical systems, quantitatively different results would be expected for the latter. However, the gyroradii encountered here were similar to those of a 6–7 MV MRI linac with a 1.5 T magnet. Conclusions: Magnetic fields impact the performance of ionization chambers also on a local level. For practical measurements this might mean a change in the effective point of measurement, in addition to any global corrections. Further knowledge about the local response will help in selecting or constructing optimized chambers for use in magnetic fields.",10.1002/mp.13591,1138997,Joerg Lehmann,Faculty of Science,School of Physics,Physics,Physical Sciences,Nuclear and plasma physics,510000,510600,0.742,,,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

Previous literature has suggested community attitudes and intrinsic factors within the decision-making process may be negatively impacting on implant uptake, however these elements have not previously been studied in detail in this context. We set out to explore community attitudes towards the contraceptive implant and the pathways to decision making around implant use in a rural community on Karkar Island, PNG. Methods: We conducted 10 focus-group (FGD) and 23 in-depth interviews (IDI) using semi-structured topic guides. Key sampling characteristics included age, exposure or non-exposure to implants, marital status, education and willingness to participate in discussion. Four FGDs were held with women, four with men and two with mixed gender. IDIs were carried out with five women (current implant users, former implant users, implant never users), five men, five religious leaders (Catholic and non-Catholic), four village leaders and four health workers. Two in-depth interviews (four participants) were analysed as dyads and the remaining participant responses were analysed individually. Results: Men were supportive of their wives using family planning but there was a community-wide lack of familiarity about the contraceptive implant which influenced its low uptake. Men perceived family planning to be 'women's business' but remained strongly influential in the decision making processes around method use. Young men were more receptive to biomedical information than older men and had a greater tendency towards wanting to use implants. Older men preferred to be guided by prominent community members for decisions concerning implants whilst young men were more likely to engage with health services directly. Conclusions: In communities where a couple's decision to use the contraceptive implant is strongly coloured by gendered roles and social perceptions, having a detailed understanding of the relational dynamics affecting the decision-making unit is useful in targeting future healthcare interventions. Engaging groups who are reluctant to connect with health information, as well as those who are most influential in the decision making process, will have the greatest impact on increasing implant acceptability and uptake.",10.1186/s12978-020-00985-w,440497075,Sarika Gupta,Faculty of Medicine and Health,Sydney Medical School,Central Clinical School: Medicine,Biomedical And Clinical Sciences,Reproductive medicine,320000,321500,0.651,Psychology,Clinical and health psychology,520000.0,520300.0,0.617,Psychology,Applied and developmental psychology,520000.0,520100.0,0.578,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True

Also, the historical, social, and cultural complexities, such as poverty and structural racism, challenge further M?ori women seeking help. In this project, we sought to answer two questions: What are M?ori women’s sociocultural constructions of “love” within relationships with violent partners? What roles do traditional cultural values play in their relationships? Using Kaupapa M?ori (by M?ori, for M?ori) methodology, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 M?ori women and analyzed them using thematic analysis. We identified three core themes that explain how M?ori women enter into, stay in, and leave a relationship with a violent partner: (a) it begins with a connection, (b) downplaying the signs, and (c) needing to leave. We found that M?ori women’s compassion and caring for their partner was underpinned by their recognition that partners had the potential to be nonviolent and resembled M?ori cultural concepts of aroha (compassion, empathy, and respect) and manaakitanga (hospitality, sharing, and caring for others). Through sharing their stories, these women revealed the strength of cultural imperatives that include the importance of whakapapa (genealogy) and whanaungatanga (connections) of which aroha and manaakitanga are integral parts. Our findings highlight the complexity and competing tensions underpinning M?ori women’s decision-making when entering and exiting violent relationships. These cultural imperatives are essential for understanding how these influence the decision-making of M?ori women, which can position them at odds with those who would tell them they must walk away and not look back.",10.1177/0886260519872298,1008118,Juanita Sherwood,DVC Indigenous Strategy and Services,DVC Indigenous Strategy and Services,Office of the DVC (Indigenous Strategy and Services),Creative Arts And Writing,Creative and professional writing,360000,360200,0.781,Indigenous Studies,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, society and community",450000.0,450500.0,0.74,Creative Arts And Writing,Other creative arts and writing,360000.0,369900.0,0.735,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False

Many organizations are involved in private food safety and/or nutrition standards that govern their food supply. With few published data on private nutrition standards, understanding the motivations behind enacting private food safety standards as a means of gaining authority may elucidate strategic opportunities of interest for the public health nutrition audience. This could positively affect the use of private standards and nutritional quality of packaged foods.Inclusion criteria:Articles to be considered must focus on private food safety standards, which principally relate to the supply chain of packaged food for retail sale, in any country. In this group, the standard is largely invisible to consumers, and the dominant actors are private firms.

There is a need to assess the impact of this emergent segment of the foodservice sector on diet and diet-related health. The aim of this narrative review was to describe the OFD sector in Australia, its use and identify potential ways to include OFD platforms in existing public health nutrition policy. Design: A search was conducted in peer-reviewed and grey literature. Sources were analysed and synthesised to report the characteristics of OFD platforms, delivery process, users and potential drivers of usage. The aim and scope of public health nutrition policies were analysed to identify ways of including OFD platforms. Setting: Australia. Participants: General population. Results: There are three main operators with 9000-16Â 000 foodservice partners based predominantly in the main cities of Australia.

A reliable, valid, and readily usable method of measuring coping is essential for occupational therapy practitioners and researchers working with children with developmental disabilities. The aim of this study was to examine evidence for the construct validity and internal and test-retest reliability of the Coping Inventory (CI), a 48-item survey designed for use with children. Method. School staff (N = 39) completed CIs for 79 students with developmental disabilities age 5-13 yr (mean = 8.0, standard deviation = 2.0) who were primarily boys (n = 52; 68%) with autism spectrum disorder (n = 40 of 47 diagnoses provided). We used Rasch analysis to examine construct validity, internal reliability, and possible redundancy of items and intraclass correlations, Pearson correlations, Bland-Altman plots, and t tests were used to examine test-retest reliability. Results. Rasch analysis provided evidence of construct validity: All items correlated positively with the overall measure; data from 94% of items conformed with Rasch expectations, and the items form a logical hierarchy. Intraclass correlations revealed an average coefficient of .96, providing evidence of test-retest reliability. Conclusion. The CI demonstrated good evidence for construct validity and internal and test-retest reliability. Redundancy of items suggests that some items could be eliminated after further research.",10.5014/ajot.2019.029561,1141351,Kassia Beetham,Faculty of Medicine and Health,School of Health Sciences,Discipline of Occupational Therapy,Psychology,Applied and developmental psychology,520000,520100,0.845,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

It was part of the pilgrimage site at Glastonbury during the Middle Ages and after the Reformation, Puritan soldiers chopped it down during the Civil War (1642-1651). However, elaborate folklore concerning the Thorn developed between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. According to these tales, Jesus came to Britain with his mother's uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, who planted the Glastonbury Thorn. The Thorn is considered miraculous, as it mowers twice yearly, with the second mowering in winter at Christmas. It also plays multiple roles in England's past and present. For example, all Christian traditions that assert that Jesus walked on soil other than that of the Middle East are engaged in the sacralization of territory, the transformation of the periphery into the center. English tales that claim Jesus visited Somerset and Cornwall bestow upon England the status of a 'Holy Land'. Further, the Thorn is part of the web of connections linking Glastonbury with the English Crown. This article considers the symbolism of the Glastonbury Thorn and assembles historical accounts, folklore, and popular cultural practices to investigate its historical importance and its contemporary signilcance.",10.1558/jsrnc.33523,1000922,Carole Cusack,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Humanities,Discipline of Studies in Religion,Philosophy And Religious Studies,Religious studies,500000,500400,0.715,Philosophy And Religious Studies,Theology,500000.0,500500.0,0.704,Creative Arts And Writing,Creative and professional writing,360000.0,360200.0,0.604,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,True

Learning design ecosystem thinking creates complex and interactive networks of activity that engage the widest span of the community in addressing critical pedagogical challenges. They identify the pinch-points where negative engagements become structured into the student experience and design pathways for students to navigate their way through the uncertainty and transitions of higher education at-scale. Design/methodology/approach: It is a conceptual paper drawing on a deep and critical engagement of literature, a reflexive approach to the dominant paradigms and informed by practice. Findings: Learning design ecosystems create spaces within at-scale education for deep learning to occur. They are not easy to design or maintain. They are epistemically and pedagogically complex, especially when deployed within the structures of an institution. As Gough (2013) argues, complexity reduction should not be the sole purpose of designing an educational experience and the transitional journey into and through complexity that students studying in these ecosystems take can engender them with resonant, deeply human and transdisciplinary graduate capabilities that will shape their career journey. Research limitations/implications: The paper is theoretical in nature (although underpinned by rigorous evaluation of practice). There are limitations in scope in part defined by the amorphous definitions of scale. It is also limited to the contexts of higher education although it is not bound to them. Originality/value: This paper challenges the dialectic that argues for a complexity reduction in higher education and posits the benefits of complexity, connection and transition in the design and delivery of education at-scale.",10.1108/JWAM-11-2023-0123,1163449,Peter Bryant,University of Sydney Business School,Sydney Business School,Faculty of Business (Business School),Education,Education systems,390000,390300,0.934,Education,Curriculum and pedagogy,390000.0,390100.0,0.821,Education,Specialist studies in education,390000.0,390400.0,0.808,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True

A digital storytelling approach extends the notion of the student experience beyond the singular and metricised descriptions common in online student satisfaction survey instruments into a rhizomatic, resonant living community that resides in the intersecting spaces of work, life, play and learning. This paper describes an ethnographic-like model of collecting and evaluating the student experience through a semi-structured digital storytelling methodology that supports both co-design and cogenerative dialogue as a form of curriculum enhancement. The paper outlines how the Student Experience Digital Storytelling model was iteratively designed, deployed, and then evaluated through participatory action research-informed case studies at the University of Sydney Business School (Australia) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (United Kingdom) that embedded the student experience into the co-design of curriculum and assessment interventions.",10.1007/s10639-022-11566-8,1163449,Peter Bryant,University of Sydney Business School,Sydney Business School,Faculty of Business (Business School),Education,Education systems,390000,390300,0.95,Education,Curriculum and pedagogy,390000.0,390100.0,0.851,Education,Specialist studies in education,390000.0,390400.0,0.786,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,True

We take the view that privilege as power and control is intimately bound up with shareholder primacy as a foundation of mainstream management education (Lund Dean & Forray, 2021). In an attempt to tackle this, we provide a single case study of how we appreciate a broad concept of Indigenous stewardship in a brand-new foundation unit called “Responsible Business Mindset,” as part of a Master of Commerce program at a large Australian university. By proactively engaging with Indigenous stewardship to tackle privilege we contribute to the literature on engaging with privilege in management education curricula. We highlight how a concept of Indigenous stewardship may help us to reimagine business, where business no longer ignores the interconnections and interdependencies it has with the communities and natural environments within which it operates. Such a concept may also be a means to bolster alternative narratives to shareholder primacy that currently exclude a meaningful debate about privilege. At the same time, the entire exercise of introducing a new concept into the curricula has brought about a deep and critical self-reflection of our own privilege and how we as educators can respectfully and meaningfully introduce such concepts with a sense of appreciation rather than appropriation.",10.1177/10525629221127648,1115980,Anna Young-Ferris,University of Sydney Business School,Sydney Business School,Accounting,Education,Curriculum and pedagogy,390000,390100,0.898,Education,Education systems,390000.0,390300.0,0.875,Education,"Education policy, sociology and philosophy",390000.0,390200.0,0.74,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False

Following a method suggested by Graeme Skinner, we recover additional information, strip out the ‘improvements’ of the arrangers and create a new Ngarigu-oriented reading with what we hope will be ‘real value for song revitalisation’ by providing ‘usable details’ of text, melody and rhythm. We suggest that the evidence tends to substantiate Skinner’s suggestion that Lhotsky’s original publication was more ‘ethnographically honest’ than Isaac Nathan’s revision. We present new conclusions as to who originally performed the Song, and when and where the performance witnessed by Lhotsky took place. We show that Lhotsky’s untranslated text is clearly in an Aboriginal language and provides important clues to its significance to Ngarigu Country. We contend that various musical features of Lhotsky’s publication, while departing from the norms of settler colonial parlour music, bear witness instead to Ngarigu performance practice of the time.",10.1080/08145857.2020.1945254,1144456,Jakelin Troy,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,School of Humanities,Discipline of Linguistics,Creative Arts And Writing,Music,360000,360300,0.901,Indigenous Studies,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, language and history",450000.0,450100.0,0.892,Indigenous Studies,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander environmental knowledges and management,450000.0,450300.0,0.891,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,True
